In this equation, 'c' represents the number of chocolate chip cookies sold and 'o' represents the number of oatmeal raisin cookies sold. The coefficients of these variables represent the price of each cookie type. Therefore, 2.25 is the price of each chocolate chip cookie and 1.50 is the price of each oatmeal raisin cookie. The question asks for the price of each oatmeal raisin cookie, which is represented by 1.50. Option C, 1.50, is the correct answer. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because: A (2.25) is the price of a chocolate chip cookie, B (1.50o) represents the total revenue from oatmeal raisin cookies, and D (2.25c) represents the total revenue from chocolate chip cookies. The question is clearly written, grammatically correct, and the difficulty level is appropriately categorized as Easy for the SAT."

The equation of line p is given in slope-intercept form, $$y = -2x + 7$$, so the slope of line p is $$m_p = -2$$. For two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must be -1. Let $$m_q$$ be the slope of line q. Then, $$m_p \\\\cdot m_q = -1$$. Substituting $$m_p = -2$$, we get $$-2 \\\\cdot m_q = -1$$. Solving for $$m_q$$, we have $$m_q = \frac{-1}{-2} = \frac{1}{2}$$. Option A, $$\frac{1}{2}$$, is indeed the correct slope.Options B, C, and D are incorrect. Option B, $$-2$$, is the slope of line p, not line q. Option C, $$2$$, would result in a product of slopes of $$-2 \times 2 = -4 \neq -1$$, so line q would not be perpendicular to line p. Option D, $$-\frac{1}{2}$$, would result in a product of slopes of $$-2 \times -\frac{1}{2} = 1 \neq -1$$, so line q would also not be perpendicular to line p.There are no grammatical or formatting issues.

The solution (x, y) = (3, 11) means x=3 apples and y=11 bananas. Option A correctly interprets this as 'If 3 apples were purchased, then 11 bananas were purchased.'

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The line on the graph passes through points (24, 0) and (0, 12). This represents the equation of the line in intercept form. We can find the equation of the line using these two points. The slope of the line is (12 - 0) / (0 - 24) = 12 / -24 = -1/2. The y-intercept is 12. So, the equation of the line is y = (-1/2)x + 12.  Alternatively, we can use the two-point form of a line equation. However, intercept form is easier here.  We can rewrite this equation to represent the total cost. Let 'x' be the number of cups of coffee and 'y' be the number of cups of tea. From the intercepts, we can infer the following: If only coffee is purchased (y=0), 24 cups can be bought for $24. If only tea is purchased (x=0), 12 cups can be bought for $24. This implies the price of one cup of coffee is $24/24 = $1, and the price of one cup of tea is $24/12 = $2. Therefore, the equation representing the total cost is 1*x + 2*y = 24, or x + 2y = 24.  Sarah purchased 6 cups of coffee, so x = 6. Substituting x = 6 into the equation: 6 + 2y = 24. Subtracting 6 from both sides gives 2y = 18. Dividing by 2 gives y = 9. Therefore, Sarah purchased 9 cups of tea. Option C is the correct answer, not option A."

Rearranging this equation to solve for the relationship between $c$ and $o$ in the form of the options provided, we subtract $o$ from both sides to get $c - o = 125$. Option B correctly represents this relationship. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they do not logically follow from the problem description. Option A suggests $c + o = 125$, implying the sum of total cookies and oatmeal raisin cookies is 125, which is not correct.

If we assume 'p' represents the volume of pine mulch in cubic feet and 'c' represents the volume of cedar mulch in cubic feet, then `p/2` is the number of bags of pine mulch and `c/1.5` is the number of bags of cedar mulch.

An x-intercept is a point where the line crosses the x-axis, and it has the form (x, 0). Option A, (3, 0), and Option D, (6, 0), are both x-intercepts. Options B, (0, 6), and C, (0, 3), are y-intercepts.  Assuming option A is marked as correct because the intended graph has an x-intercept at (3, 0), then option A would be the correct answer, and options B and C would be clearly incorrect as they are y-intercepts. Option D would be incorrect if the x-intercept is indeed at x=3. However, without the actual graph, we cannot definitively confirm the correctness of option A or the incorrectness of other options based on visual information. The primary issue is the missing image, which renders the question invalid in its current form."

To verify the correct answer, we can plug in the given values into the formula: $P = 2l + 2w$. We are given $P = 32$ and $l = 10$.

Substituting the point $(0, -2)$ into the equation $px + qy = -10$, we get: $p(0) + q(-2) = -10$, which simplifies to $-2q = -10$. Solving for $q$, we divide both sides by $-2$ to get $q = \frac{-10}{-2} = 5$. To verify, we can also use the point $(2, -4)$. Substituting this point and $q=5$ into the equation, we get: $p(2) + 5(-4) = -10$, which simplifies to $2p - 20 = -10$. Adding 20 to both sides gives $2p = 10$, so $p = 5$.

      ],
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and asks for a table of values that satisfy the given linear equation $$y = \frac{2}{3}x - 1$$. To check each option, we substitute the given $x$ values into the equation and verify if the corresponding $y$ values match.\n\nOption A:\n- For x=0, y = (2/3)(0) - 1 = -1, but the table shows y = -3. Incorrect.\n\nOption B:\n- For x=0, y = (2/3)(0) - 1 = -1, but the table shows y = 1. Incorrect.\n\nOption C:\n- For x=0, y = (2/3)(0) - 1 = -1. Correct.\n- For x=3, y = (2/3)(3) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1, but the table shows y = 0. Incorrect.\n\nOption D:\n- For x=0, y = (2/3)(0) - 1 = -1. Correct.\n- For x=3, y = (2/3)(3) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1. Correct.\n- For x=6, y = (2/3)(6) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3. Correct.\n\nOption D is the only option where all three pairs of (x, y) values satisfy the given equation. Therefore, option D is the correct answer, and options A, B, and C are clearly incorrect. There are no grammatical or formatting issues. The question is valid, but the difficulty level is overestimated."
