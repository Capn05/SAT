To find the length, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length × Width. Given Area = 48 square feet and Width = 6 feet, we can solve for Length: Length = Area / Width = 48 / 6 = 8 feet. Option A, which is marked as correct, is indeed 8. Options B, C, and D are clearly incorrect as they do not result from the correct application of the area formula. Option B (42) might be obtained by subtracting the width from the area, Option C (54) by adding the width to the area, and Option D (288) by multiplying the area and the width. None of these operations are relevant to finding the length given the area and width.

Since triangles PQR and XYZ are similar and PQ and XY are corresponding sides, the ratio of their corresponding sides is XY/PQ = 3PQ/PQ = 3. For similar triangles, the ratio of their perimeters is equal to the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the perimeter of triangle XYZ is 3 times the perimeter of triangle PQR. Given that the perimeter of triangle PQR is 15, the perimeter of triangle XYZ is 3 * 15 = 45. Option C, 45, is indeed the correct answer. Options A, B, and D are clearly incorrect as they do not represent 3 times the perimeter of triangle PQR. There are no grammatical or formatting issues.

To find the height of a right circular cylinder, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: Volume = Base Area × Height. We are given the volume (540 cubic centimeters) and the base area (36 square centimeters). To find the height, we can rearrange the formula to: Height = Volume / Base Area. Plugging in the given values, we get Height = 540 / 36 = 15 centimeters. Option C, which is marked as correct, is indeed 15. The other options are incorrect because: Option A (10 cm) gives a volume of 36 * 10 = 360 cubic centimeters, Option B (12 cm) gives a volume of 36 * 12 = 432 cubic centimeters, and Option D (18 cm) gives a volume of 36 * 18 = 648 cubic centimeters. None of these volumes match the given volume of 540 cubic centimeters.

If we assume that the table implicitly states the perimeter of triangle TUV is 10, and the question is asking for the perimeter of triangle XYZ, and option D (30) is indeed the correct answer, then the solution would be as follows: For similar triangles, the ratio of perimeters is equal to the ratio of corresponding sides. Let $P_{TUV}$ and $P_{XYZ}$ be the perimeters of triangles $TUV$ and $XYZ$ respectively. Then, $P_{TUV} / P_{XYZ} = TU / XY$. If we assume $P_{TUV} = 10$ and $P_{XYZ} = 30$ (option D), then $P_{TUV} / P_{XYZ} = 10 / 30 = 1/3$. This implies $TU / XY = 1/3$. Given $TU = 10$, we have $10 / XY = 1/3$, which gives $XY = 30$.  While mathematically consistent under these assumptions, the question is fundamentally flawed due to the missing table and lack of clarity.
