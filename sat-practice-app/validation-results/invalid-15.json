      "The question is poorly written and confusing due to the contradictory definition of variables 'p' and 'c'. The question states that 'p' and 'c' represent the 'number of bags' of pine and cedar mulch respectively, but the equation `6.00(p/2) + 7.50(c/1.5) + 108 = T` is structured as if 'p' and 'c' represent the *volume* of pine and cedar mulch in cubic feet. If 'p' were the number of bags of pine mulch, the cost of pine mulch should be represented as `6.00p`, not `6.00(p/2)`. Similarly for cedar mulch. This inconsistency makes the question ambiguous and difficult to understand.",
      "While option A is likely the intended correct answer based on the structure of the equation and the process of elimination, the question's flawed wording undermines its validity as a clear and unambiguous SAT question.",
      "The difficulty level is likely miscategorized as 'Easy'. The ambiguity and potential misinterpretation of variables make it more of a medium difficulty question, as students need to infer the intended meaning despite the confusing wording."

Since each loaf of bread costs $7, the number of loaves would be $32 / $7, which is not an integer. Therefore, there is no integer solution for the number of loaves of bread when the customer buys 4 muffins and the total cost is $44.",
