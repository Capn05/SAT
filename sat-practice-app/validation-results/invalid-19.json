      "The option marked as correct (B) is not exactly correct for the question as stated. The mean number of books read is 62/9, and the median number of books read is 8. The difference (mean - median) is 62/9 - 8 = -10/9, which is approximately -1.11.  None of the options are close to -10/9. However, if we calculate median - mean, we get 8 - 62/9 = 10/9, which is approximately 1.11. The closest integer option to 10/9 is 1, which is option B. It is possible the question intended to ask for 'how much greater is the median than the mean' or is looking for the closest integer to the absolute difference or median - mean, but as written, the mathematically correct answer for 'how much greater is the mean than the median' is -10/9, which is not among the options and not close to the marked correct answer.",
      "The question might be interpreted as asking for the closest integer to the positive difference between the median and the mean, in which case option B (1) would be the closest integer to 10/9. However, this interpretation is not explicitly stated in the question, making it potentially ambiguous."
