      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and asks for an equivalent inequality to 10x + 5y < 20. To find an equivalent inequality, we can divide all terms of the given inequality by a positive number. Dividing by 5, we get: (10x + 5y) / 5 < 20 / 5, which simplifies to 2x + y < 4. Option B, 2x + y < 4, is therefore the correct equivalent inequality. Options A, C, and D are not equivalent to the original inequality. Option A has the inequality sign reversed. Option C has a subtraction sign instead of addition between 2x and y. Option D has the coefficients of x and y swapped. The difficulty level 'Easy' is appropriate as it requires a single straightforward simplification step.

Let the two integer solutions be $x_1$ and $x_2$. According to Vieta's formulas, for a quadratic equation of the form $x^2 - bx + 18 = 0$, the sum of the roots is $x_1 + x_2 = b$ and the product of the roots is $x_1 \\\\cdot x_2 = 18$. We need to find pairs of integers whose product is 18. The pairs of positive integer factors of 18 are (1, 18), (2, 9), and (3, 6). The corresponding sums are:  1 + 18 = 19  2 + 9 = 11  3 + 6 = 9  Thus, possible positive integer values for b are 19, 11, and 9.  Checking the options:  A. 9 - This is a possible value of b, corresponding to integer solutions 3 and 6 (since 3*6=18 and 3+6=9). If b=9, the equation is $x^2 - 9x + 18 = 0$, which factors to $(x-3)(x-6) = 0$, giving integer solutions x=3 and x=6.  B. 10 - If b=10, we need to find two integers that multiply to 18 and add up to 10. Let's check factors of 18: 1 and 18 (sum=19), 2 and 9 (sum=11), 3 and 6 (sum=9). No integer pair sums to 10.

To solve this equation, we can first bring all terms to one side: $$3(x - 2) - 12(x + 3)(x - 2) = 0$$. Factor out the common term $(x - 2)$: $$(x - 2)[3 - 12(x + 3)] = 0$$. This gives us two possible cases: \n\nCase 1: $x - 2 = 0$, which means $x = 2$.\n\nCase 2: $3 - 12(x + 3) = 0$. Simplify this equation: $$3 - 12x - 36 = 0$$ $$-12x - 33 = 0$$ $$-12x = 33$$ $$x = -\frac{33}{12} = -\frac{11}{4} = -2.75$$.\n\nThe solutions are $x = 2$ and $x = -2.75$. The sum of the solutions is $2 + (-2.75) = -0.75$. Option A, -0.75, is indeed the correct answer. Options B, C, and D are incorrect. Option B and C are individual solutions, not the sum, and Option D is not related to the solutions. The difficulty level 'Hard' is appropriate for SAT as it requires algebraic manipulation and solving a non-linear equation. There are no grammatical or formatting issues."

      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and makes sense. To verify the correct answer, we first solve the quadratic equations $x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0$ and $x^2 - 6x + 7 = 0$.For $x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0$, using the quadratic formula, the solutions are $x = \frac{-(-2) \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} = \frac{2 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{2 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{8}}{2} = 1 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{2}$. Since $p < q$, we have $p = 1 - \\\\sqrt{2}$ and $q = 1 + \\\\sqrt{2}$.For $x^2 - 6x + 7 = 0$, using the quadratic formula, the solutions are $x = \frac{-(-6) \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4(1)(7)}}{2(1)} = \frac{6 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{36 - 28}}{2} = \frac{6 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{8}}{2} = 3 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{2}$. Since $v < w$, we have $v = 3 - \\\\sqrt{2}$ and $w = 3 + \\\\sqrt{2}$.The solutions to $x^2 + kx + c = 0$ are given as $p + v$ and $q + w$.$p + v = (1 - \\\\sqrt{2}) + (3 - \\\\sqrt{2}) = 4 - 2\\\\sqrt{2}$$q + w = (1 + \\\\sqrt{2}) + (3 + \\\\sqrt{2}) = 4 + 2\\\\sqrt{2}$For a quadratic equation $x^2 + kx + c = 0$, the product of the roots is equal to $c$. Therefore, $c = (p + v)(q + w) = (4 - 2\\\\sqrt{2})(4 + 2\\\\sqrt{2})$.Using the difference of squares formula $(a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2$, we get $c = 4^2 - (2\\\\sqrt{2})^2 = 16 - (4 \times 2) = 16 - 8 = 8$.The value of $c$ is 8, which corresponds to option A. All other options are incorrect as there is a unique value for $c$. The question is grammatically correct and appropriately categorized as 'Hard' for the SAT. There are no formatting issues."
