      "The question text is incomplete and unclear. It mentions 'two types of advertisements' but only describes one type as 'No image'. The description of 'No image' is vague and doesn't provide enough information about the advertisement type.",
      "Without a complete description of both advertisement types and the study's findings, it is impossible to definitively determine if option A is the correct inference.",
      "Similarly, without the study details, it's impossible to definitively say if options B, C, and D are clearly incorrect. Their correctness depends entirely on the missing context of the study.",
      "There is a formatting issue in the question text: 'One type, \\\\\\\\\\ No image'. The backslash before 'No image' is likely a typo or formatting error.",
      "Due to the lack of context and incomplete question text, the difficulty level cannot be accurately assessed. While the options themselves are relatively straightforward to understand, the question's answerability is severely compromised by the missing information.",

    "issues": [
      "The question text is incomplete and ends mid-sentence, making it impossible to understand what Dr. Reyes is examining. The phrase 'examines the' is followed by no further information.",
      "The mention of 'No image' suggests that crucial visual or textual information related to Dr. Reyes' study is missing, which is essential for answering the question.",
      "Without the complete question text and context (including the missing image or text), it is impossible to definitively confirm if option B is the correct answer or if other options are clearly incorrect. The correctness of option B is based on an assumption of what the question *might* be asking.",
      "Due to the incompleteness, it is impossible to accurately assess the difficulty level. While 'Medium' might be intended, the lack of a complete question renders this assessment speculative."

    "issues": [
      "Option A, Option C, and Option D are also plausible explanations for the modest increase in recycling, making Option B not definitively the *only* or *best* correct answer. The question, while asking for 'One potential explanation', implies there should be a single *best* answer in the context of SAT questions. Option A, in particular, is a strong alternative correct answer as methodological differences would directly invalidate the comparison and explain a seemingly 'modest' increase that might not be real at all."
