The ratio of miles to gallons is given as 55 to 1, meaning for every 1 gallon of fuel consumed, the car travels 55 miles. To find out how many miles the car will travel if it consumes 3 gallons of fuel, we multiply the ratio by 3: 55 miles/gallon * 3 gallons = 165 miles. Option A, 165, is the correct answer and is marked as correct. Options B, C, and D are clearly incorrect as they do not result from a correct application of the given ratio.

The other options are clearly incorrect: Option A (0.03) is too small and likely results from dividing hours by cakes instead of cakes by hours. Option C (465) is larger than the total number of cakes produced and doesn't logically represent cakes per hour.

      "explanation": "To solve this problem, we need to find the constant rate of practice problems completed per hour. From the information given, we can infer two data points from the table (although the table itself is missing): (hours, problems). Let's assume there are at least two rows in the table, and we can use the given information to find the constant rate.  However, since we don't have the actual table, let's use the information provided in the question and options to deduce the intended logic.  If we assume the rate is constant across all entries in the table, we can use any two pairs of (hours, problems) to find the rate and then use it to find 'p'.  Let's assume the table has at least two rows where we know both hours and problems, and one row where we know hours (3) and need to find problems (p).  However, based on the question description and the marked answer being C (105), it seems there is an error either in the question itself, the marked answer, or the options provided.  If we assume the rate is constant, and we take two hypothetical rows from the table as (2, 30) and (5, 75) as suggested by typical rate problems, the rate is 30/2 = 15 problems per hour and also 75/5 = 15 problems per hour.  If the hours for the unknown value 'p' is 3, then p = rate * hours = 15 * 3 = 45.  However, 45 is not among the options, and option C (105) is marked as correct. If p = 105, the rate would be 105/3 = 35 problems per hour. This rate is not consistent with the rate derived from (2, 30) or (5, 75) unless the initial data points are incorrect or there is a misunderstanding of the question's intent.  Therefore, based on the clear wording of 'constant rate', the marked answer is incorrect, and the question as presented is flawed due to the discrepancy between the expected answer and the provided options and marked correct answer."

Let F be the amount of flour and S be the amount of sugar. Initially, F/S = 5/2. If the new amount of flour is 2.5F, let the new amount of sugar be xS. To maintain the ratio, (2.5F) / (xS) = 5/2.

After 2 hours, there are 3*(3x) = 9x bacteria. After 3 hours, there are 3*(9x) = 27x bacteria. We are given that after 3 hours, there are 8,100 bacteria. So, 27x = 8100. Solving for x, we get x = 8100 / 27 = 300. Therefore, there were 300 bacteria at the start of the experiment. Option A, 300, is indeed the correct answer. Options B, C, and D are incorrect as they do not lead to 8,100 bacteria after 3 hours of tripling. The difficulty level 'Hard' is appropriate for SAT as it requires understanding of exponential growth and working backwards to solve the problem."

      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and makes sense. To find the total water usage for Region B in a week, we need to perform the following calculation:\n\n1. **Calculate daily water usage for Region B:**\n   Water Usage Rate (Region B) = 600 gallons per acre per day\n   Acres Planted (Region B) = 150 acres\n   Daily Water Usage (Region B) = Water Usage Rate * Acres Planted = 600 gallons/acre/day * 150 acres = 90,000 gallons per day\n\n2. **Calculate weekly water usage for Region B:**\n   Weekly Water Usage (Region B) = Daily Water Usage * Number of days in a week = 90,000 gallons/day * 7 days = 630,000 gallons\n\nOption C, 630,000, is the correct answer. \n\nLet's examine the other options:\n- Option A (600): This is only the water usage rate per acre per day and does not account for the number of acres or the number of days.\n- Option B (90,000): This is the daily water usage for Region B, but the question asks for the weekly usage.\n- Option D (840,000): This option is incorrect as it doesn't result from a logical calculation based on the given data. \n\nThe question is grammatically correct and well-formatted. The difficulty level 'Hard' is appropriate for the SAT as it requires multiple steps and understanding of rates and units. While not extremely complex, it requires careful reading and calculation, making it suitable for the 'Hard' category on the SAT."

      "issues": [],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and makes sense. To find the length of one edge of the cube, we need to use the formula for density: Density = Mass / Volume. First, we need to find the volume of the gold sample. Rearranging the formula, we get Volume = Mass / Density. Plugging in the given values, Volume = 25 kg / 19,300 kg/m³ ≈ 0.001295 m³. Since the sample is a cube, its volume is given by V = s³, where s is the length of an edge. To find s, we take the cube root of the volume: s = ³√V = ³√0.001295 m³ ≈ 0.1090 m. Rounding to the nearest hundredth of a meter, we get 0.11 meters. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. Options A, B, and D are incorrect as they would result in masses significantly different from 25 kg when calculated using the given density. The difficulty level 'Hard' is appropriate as it requires multiple steps and understanding of density and volume concepts."

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and makes sense. The ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus is given as 5:2.  If the gardener uses 12.5 pounds of nitrogen, we can set up a proportion to find the amount of phosphorus needed to maintain the ratio: \n\n(Nitrogen ratio) / (Phosphorus ratio) = (Nitrogen amount) / (Phosphorus amount)\n\n5 / 2 = 12.5 / x\n\nTo solve for x (phosphorus amount), we can cross-multiply:\n\n5 * x = 2 * 12.5\n5x = 25\nx = 25 / 5\nx = 5\n\nTherefore, the gardener should use 5 pounds of phosphorus. Option A is indeed the correct answer. The other options (B, C, and D) are incorrect because they do not maintain the 5:2 ratio when 12.5 pounds of nitrogen is used. The difficulty level is arguably on the higher end of medium or lower end of hard for SAT, as it requires setting up and solving a proportion, which is a common skill tested on the SAT.  There are no grammatical or formatting issues."

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and makes sense. To solve it, first calculate the volume of the cubic mold: Volume = (edge length)^3 = (2.00 cm)^3 = 8.00 cubic centimeters. Then, use the density formula: Mass = Density × Volume = 19.3 grams/cm³ × 8.00 cm³ = 154.4 grams. Option D (154.4) is the correct answer. Options A, B, and C are incorrect and represent plausible distractors based on common errors (like using density directly or miscalculating volume). There are no grammatical or formatting issues. While the calculation is straightforward, the question requires understanding of density, volume, and unit conversion, making 'Hard' a potentially justifiable, though perhaps slightly overstated, difficulty level for the SAT. A more precise difficulty might be 'Medium-Hard'."
