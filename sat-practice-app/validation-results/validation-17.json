Let x be the total number of fruits in the first basket and y be the total number of fruits in the second basket.  In the first basket, 20% are apples, so there are 0.2x apples. In the second basket, 60% are apples, so there are 0.6y apples. The total number of apples is the sum of apples from both baskets, which is 0.2x + 0.6y. The question states that together, the baskets must contain 'at least 300 apples', which translates to 'greater than or equal to 300'. Therefore, the correct inequality is 0.2x + 0.6y ≥ 300, which is option A.Option B is incorrect because it reverses the percentages, applying 60% to the first basket and 20% to the second. Option C is incorrect because it uses '≤' (less than or equal to), meaning 'at most 300 apples', which contradicts the requirement of 'at least 300 apples'. Option D is incorrect because it uses '<' (less than), meaning 'less than 300 apples', also contradicting the requirement of 'at least 300 apples'.There are no grammatical or formatting issues.

To maximize 'y', we should minimize 'x' while satisfying both constraints. \n\nLet's test option C (12 large boxes). If y = 12, the weight from large boxes is 50 * 12 = 600 pounds. To meet the minimum box requirement (x + y ≥ 12), we can have x = 0. In this case, x + y = 0 + 12 = 12, and the total weight is 30*0 + 50*12 = 600 pounds. Both conditions are satisfied. \n\nNow let's check if we can have more than 12 large boxes.

      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and makes sense. To find the number of years (t) when the total electricity cost savings exceed the installation cost, we first need to calculate the annual savings. The annual savings from switching to LED bulbs is the difference between the current annual cost and the new annual cost: $1,500 - $900 = $600 per year.  The total savings after t years will be $600t. We want to find when this total savings exceeds the installation cost of $4,800.  This can be represented by the inequality: 600t > 4,800.  Option B, 4,800 < (1,500 - 900)t, simplifies to 4,800 < 600t, which is the correct inequality. Options A, C, and D do not correctly represent the relationship described in the problem. Option A represents when the installation cost is greater than the savings. Option C and D do not correctly formulate the savings or compare it to the installation cost in the way described in the problem.

So, the total number of representatives who achieved the target must be greater than 30% of 200.Mathematically, this can be written as:45 + q > 0.30 * 200Option A is: q + 45 > 0.30(200), where q ≤ 100. This inequality correctly represents the condition and also includes the constraint that q cannot be greater than 100, as there are only 100 representatives in the second group.Let's examine why other options are incorrect:Option B: q > 0.30(200 + 45), where q ≤ 100. This option incorrectly adds 45 to 200 before multiplying by 0.30. It should be 30% of the total number of representatives (200), not 30% of (200 + 45).Option C: q - 45 > 0.30(200), where q < 100. This option incorrectly subtracts 45 from q. It should be the sum of successful representatives from both groups (45 + q) that is compared to 30% of 200. Also, the constraint q < 100 is not as precise as q ≤ 100, although in the context of number of people, q must be an integer and less than or equal to 100. However, the main issue is the subtraction.Option D: q + 45 > 0.30(100), where q ≤ 100. This option incorrectly calculates 30% of 100 instead of 30% of the total number of representatives, which is 200.Therefore, Option A is the only correct option.
