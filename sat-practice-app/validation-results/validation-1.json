Option A, when expanded, is $6y(2y^2 + 3y - 1) = 6y \times 2y^2 + 6y \times 3y - 6y \times 1 = 12y^3 + 18y^2 - 6y$, which is the original expression. Therefore, Option A is indeed the correct answer.Let's check the other options:Option B: $2y(6y^2 + 9y - 1) = 2y \times 6y^2 + 2y \times 9y - 2y \times 1 = 12y^3 + 18y^2 - 2y$.

This is not equivalent to the original expression because the middle term is $-18y^2$ instead of $+18y^2$, and the last term is $+6y$ instead of $-6y$.Option D: $6(2y^2 + 3y - 1) = 6 \times 2y^2 + 6 \times 3y - 6 \times 1 = 12y^2 + 18y - 6$. This is not equivalent to the original expression because the degree of the first term is $y^2$ instead of $y^3$.All options except A are clearly incorrect.

      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and asks to simplify the given expression $(4250 + 50x^2) + 5(20x^2 - 200)$ into the form $ax^2 + b$ and find the value of $a + b$. \n\nStep 1: Distribute the 5 in the second term: \n$5(20x^2 - 200) = 100x^2 - 1000$\n\nStep 2: Substitute this back into the original expression:\n$(4250 + 50x^2) + (100x^2 - 1000)$\n\nStep 3: Combine like terms:\n$(50x^2 + 100x^2) + (4250 - 1000) = 150x^2 + 3250$\n\nStep 4: Identify $a$ and $b$ by comparing $150x^2 + 3250$ to $ax^2 + b$:\n$a = 150$ and $b = 3250$\n\nStep 5: Calculate $a + b$:\n$a + b = 150 + 3250 = 3400$\n\nThe correct answer is 3400, which corresponds to option A. Options B, C, and D are incorrect. The question is grammatically sound and formatted correctly. The difficulty level is appropriate for 'Hard' within the SAT Advanced Math section, as it requires algebraic manipulation and understanding of equivalent expressions."

      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and makes sense. We are given that β = p - q and asked to find an equivalent expression for $y^2 - p^2 + 2pq - q^2$. We can rewrite the expression as $y^2 - (p^2 - 2pq + q^2)$. Recognizing that $p^2 - 2pq + q^2 = (p - q)^2 = β^2$, we can substitute β into the expression to get $y^2 - β^2$.  This expression is a difference of squares, which can be factored as $(y + β)(y - β)$. Option B, (y + β)(y - β), is therefore the correct equivalent expression.Let's check the other options:Option A: (y - β)² = $y^2 - 2βy + β^2$, which is not equal to $y^2 - β^2$.Option C: $y^2 - βy - β^2$, which is not equal to $y^2 - β^2$.Option D: $y^2 + β^2$, which is not equal to $y^2 - β^2$.All options except B are clearly incorrect. There are no grammatical or formatting issues. The difficulty level 'Hard' is appropriate as it requires algebraic manipulation and pattern recognition, which is typical for advanced SAT math questions."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and mathematically sound. To solve for x in the equation $(5^2)^x = \\\\sqrt[4]{5^3}$, we first simplify both sides using exponent rules. On the left side, $(5^2)^x = 5^{2x}$. On the right side, $\\\\sqrt[4]{5^3} = (5^3)^{\frac{1}{4}} = 5^{\frac{3}{4}}$.  Setting the exponents equal, we have $2x = \frac{3}{4}$. Dividing both sides by 2, we get $x = \frac{3}{4} \\\\div 2 = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{8}$. Option B, $\frac{3}{8}$, is indeed the correct answer. The other options are incorrect as substituting them back into the original equation will not satisfy the equality. The difficulty level 'Hard' is appropriate for an SAT question testing exponent manipulation and equation solving skills, especially within the 'Advanced Math' category."
