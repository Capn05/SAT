    "issues": [
      "The option marked as correct (A. 150) is incorrect based on the provided information. The calculated difference between the recommended daily intake of potassium and calcium is 750 milligrams, not 150 milligrams.  The question asks for 'how many more milligrams of calcium than potassium', which mathematically translates to Calcium intake - Potassium intake.  Based on the given ratios and sodium intake, Potassium intake = 3500 mg and Calcium intake = 2750 mg. Therefore, Calcium intake - Potassium intake = 2750 - 3500 = -750 mg.  If we consider the absolute difference, it is 750 mg.  Neither -750 nor 750 is option A. Option A (150) is exactly 1/5 of 750, which suggests a possible error in the question design or the intended answer was derived through an unstated operation (like dividing the actual difference by 5).  However, as the question is presented, option A is not the correct answer.  All other options are also incorrect as they are not close to the calculated difference of 750 or -750.",
      "The question is clearly written and makes sense in its wording, but the numerical values provided lead to a different answer than the marked correct option. This discrepancy makes the question invalid as a correctly answered question should have one of the provided options as the accurate result of the calculation described in the question."

      "The option marked as correct (B) is not actually the correct answer when using the provided conversion factor and rounding to the nearest tenth. Based on the given information (1 fluid ounce â‰ˆ 29.6 milliliters and 740 milliliters of liquid), the correct calculation is 740 / 29.6 = 25.0 fluid ounces. Option B, 24.9, is close but not mathematically accurate to the nearest tenth based on the provided data. While it might be considered an approximation, for a math question on the SAT, especially at 'Easy' difficulty, a more precise answer is expected, and option B deviates from the mathematically correct answer of 25.0 when rounded to the nearest tenth."
