In the given equation, $B$ is analogous to $y$, $250$ is analogous to $a$, $1.2$ is analogous to $b$, and $t$ is analogous to $x$. Therefore, 250 represents the initial number of bacteria when $t=0$. Let's check the options:\n\nA. **The initial number of bacteria in the petri dish:** When $t=0$, $B = 250(1.2)^0 = 250(1) = 250$. This is the number of bacteria at the beginning (initial number).

Let's analyze each option:\n\n* **Option A: V = 100(0.20)^t** - This formula represents exponential decay, not growth, because the base (0.20) is less than 1.  Also, 0.20 represents 20% *of* the previous year's sales being retained, not a 20% *increase*.\n\n* **Option B: V = 100(1.20)^t** - This formula represents exponential growth. The base (1.20) is greater than 1, indicating growth.  1.20 represents 100% (the original amount) + 20% (the increase), which correctly models a 20% annual increase. When t=0 (2015), V = 100(1.20)^0 = 100, which corresponds to 100,000 vehicles, matching the initial condition. This option correctly models the scenario.\n\n* **Option C: V = 100 + 20t** - This formula represents linear growth. It adds a constant amount (20, which represents 20,000 vehicles since V is in thousands) each year, rather than a percentage increase. This does not model the described scenario of a percentage increase.\n\n* **Option D: V = 100(0.80)^t** - This formula represents exponential decay with a 20% decrease each year. 0.80 represents 100% - 20% = 80% remaining from the previous year. This is the opposite of the described growth.\n\nTherefore, option B is the only option that correctly models the exponential growth of 20% per year. The question is clearly written, and the difficulty level of 'Medium' is appropriate for an SAT Advanced Math question testing understanding of exponential functions and their application in word problems. All other options are clearly incorrect as they represent either decay or linear growth, neither of which matches the problem description."

Calculating $P(100) = -0.1(100)^2 + 50(100) - 1000 = -1000 + 5000 - 1000 = 3000$ confirms that this statement is correct according to the model.

This option misinterprets the base 0.85.  0.85 represents the value *remaining* (85%), not the value decreased. A decrease of 85% would mean the value is multiplied by (1 - 0.85) = 0.15 each year, which is not the case here.\n\nC. Correct.

      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and makes sense. The table provides data for exponential growth, and the question asks to find the day when the insect population reaches a specific value. To solve this, we first determine the growth factor by dividing the population of Day 2 by Day 1 (or Day 3 by Day 2). The growth factor is $3.6 \times 10^4 / 1.2 \times 10^4 = 3$.  We can express the population on day $n$ as $P_n = P_1 \times 3^{n-1}$, where $P_1 = 1.2 \times 10^4$. We need to find $n$ such that $P_n = 8.748 \times 10^6$.  Setting up the equation: $8.748 \times 10^6 = (1.2 \times 10^4) \times 3^{n-1}$. Dividing both sides by $1.2 \times 10^4$ gives $729 = 3^{n-1}$. Since $3^6 = 729$, we have $n-1 = 6$, so $n = 7$. Therefore, Day 7 is the correct answer, which corresponds to option B.  Checking other options: Day 5 would have a population of $1.2 \times 10^4 \times 3^{5-1} = 9.72 \times 10^5$, Day 9 would have $1.2 \times 10^4 \times 3^{9-1} = 7.8732 \times 10^7$, and Day 11 would have $1.2 \times 10^4 \times 3^{11-1} = 7.08588 \times 10^8$.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The question states that the value of the painting decreases by a fixed percentage each year. The given formula is $V = V_0 (1 + k)^{t}$. For the value to decrease over time ($t$ increasing), the base of the exponentiation, $(1 + k)$, must be between 0 and 1 (exclusive of 0 and inclusive of values arbitrarily close to 0, but since value is about painting, value should be positive, so base should be positive).  If $0 < (1 + k) < 1$, then subtracting 1 from all parts of the inequality gives $-1 < k < 0$.Let's examine each option:A. $k < -1$: If $k < -1$, then $1 + k < 0$. In this case, the value $V$ would not consistently decrease by a fixed percentage. For instance, if $k = -2$, $V = V_0 (-1)^t$, which oscillates between $V_0$ and $-V_0$ (or $V_0$ and $V_0$ if we consider absolute value decrease, but percentage decrease is not well-defined for negative values in this context and it's not a fixed percentage decrease).B. $-1 < k < 0$: If $-1 < k < 0$, then $0 < 1 + k < 1$. Let $1 + k = r$, where $0 < r < 1$. Then $V = V_0 r^t$. As $t$ increases, $r^t$ decreases (since $0 < r < 1$), so $V$ decreases.  The percentage decrease each year is constant. For example, from year $t$ to year $t+1$, the value changes from $V_0 r^t$ to $V_0 r^{t+1} = (V_0 r^t) \times r$. The value is multiplied by a constant factor $r < 1$ each year, representing a fixed percentage decrease of $(1-r) \times 100\\\\% = (-k) \times 100\\\\%$.C. $0 < k < 1$: If $0 < k < 1$, then $1 < 1 + k < 2$. In this case, as $t$ increases, $(1 + k)^t$ increases, so $V$ increases, which contradicts the condition that the value decreases.D. $k > 1$: If $k > 1$, then $1 + k > 2$. In this case, as $t$ increases, $(1 + k)^t$ increases, so $V$ increases, which contradicts the condition that the value decreases.Therefore, option B is the only option that ensures the value of the painting decreases by a fixed percentage each year. The difficulty level 'Hard' is appropriate as it requires understanding of exponential functions and their behavior for different base values in the context of percentage decrease."

The area of the rectangle is given by length * width, which is (2w) * w = 2w^2. We are given that the area is 128 square inches. So, we have the equation 2w^2 = 128. Dividing both sides by 2, we get w^2 = 64. Taking the square root of both sides, we get w = 8 (since width must be positive). Therefore, the width is 8 inches, which corresponds to option A.Options B, C, and D are incorrect.- If width = 6 inches, length = 12 inches, Area = 6 * 12 = 72 square inches (not 128).- If width = 12 inches, length = 24 inches, Area = 12 * 24 = 288 square inches (not 128).- If width = 16 inches, length = 32 inches, Area = 16 * 32 = 512 square inches (not 128).There are no grammatical or formatting issues.While the question is solvable and valid, classifying it as 'Hard' and under 'Advanced Math' -> 'Nonlinear Functions' might be slightly misleading.

This function represents exponential decay, but let's check if it fits the data. At m=4, $T(4) = 80 (0.85)^4 \\\\approx 41.76°C$, which is significantly lower than the given 65°C at 7:04 a.m.\n\nOption C: $T(m) = (80 - 20) (0.75)^{\frac{m}{4}} = 60 (0.75)^{\frac{m}{4}}$. At m=0, $T(0) = 60 (0.75)^0 = 60°C$. This function starts at 60°C, not 80°C as given in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, options A, B, and C are clearly incorrect. Option D is the only function that accurately models the given data and represents exponential decay towards the room temperature of 20°C. The difficulty level of 'Hard' is appropriate as it requires understanding exponential functions and applying them to a real-world context, as well as testing each option against the given data."

The $t$-intercept occurs when $f(t) = 0$, which means the height of the ball above the ground is zero. This corresponds to the moment when the ball hits the ground.Let's examine each option:A. The initial height of the ball above the ground: This corresponds to $f(0)$. $f(0) = -16(0)^2 + 48(0) + 64 = 64$. This is the y-intercept, not the t-intercept.B. The maximum height of the ball above the ground: The maximum height occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The t-coordinate of the vertex is given by $t = -b/(2a) = -48 / (2 \times -16) = -48 / -32 = 3/2 = 1.5$.  The maximum height is $f(1.5) = -16(1.5)^2 + 48(1.5) + 64 = 100$. This is the maximum height value, not related to the t-intercept.C. The time at which the ball reaches its maximum height: As calculated above, the time at which the ball reaches its maximum height is $t = 1.5$. This is not the t-intercept.D. The time at which the ball hits the ground: As determined earlier, the positive t-intercept $t = 4$ corresponds to when $f(t) = 0$, which means the ball hits the ground.

By observing the pattern in the table, we can deduce the form of the function. When x increases by 1, the exponent of 'a' increases by 4 (from 3 to 7, and from 7 to 11). This suggests a linear relationship in the exponent of the form 4x + c. Using the first point (1, a^3), we have 4(1) + c = 3, which gives c = -1. Thus, the function is f(x) = a^(4x - 1). We are given that f(k) = a^31. Substituting the function form, we get a^(4k - 1) = a^31. Equating the exponents, we have 4k - 1 = 31. Solving for k, we get 4k = 32, so k = 8.

Substituting $x=k$ into the function definition, we get $q(k) = \frac{(k-k)^2 + 80}{4k} = \frac{0 + 80}{4k} = \frac{80}{4k}$. We are given that $q(k) = 5$, so we have $\frac{80}{4k} = 5$. Multiplying both sides by $4k$ gives $80 = 20k$, and dividing by 20 gives $k = \frac{80}{20} = 4$.Now that we know $k=4$, we can write the function as $q(x) = \frac{(x-4)^2 + 80}{4x}$. We need to find $q(10)$. Substituting $x=10$ into the function, we get $q(10) = \frac{(10-4)^2 + 80}{4 \times 10} = \frac{(6)^2 + 80}{40} = \frac{36 + 80}{40} = \frac{116}{40}$.To simplify $\frac{116}{40}$, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4.
