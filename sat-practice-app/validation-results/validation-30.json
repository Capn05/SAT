Option B accurately summarizes the main points of the text, which highlights various benefits for city residents' well-being (stress reduction, mental health, physical activity) and the environment (mitigating heat island effect, improving air quality, supporting biodiversity). Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they are not supported by the text. Option A focuses on public events, which are not mentioned.

      "explanation": "The question is implicitly asking for the central idea or a brief summary of the provided passage about Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin. Option A, 'A fungal growth in a laboratory,' accurately describes the initial observation that led to the discovery, as Fleming noticed mold (fungal growth) in a petri dish (laboratory). This is the direct starting point of the story described in the passage.Option B, 'A new type of bacteria,' is incorrect because the passage is about the discovery of penicillin from mold, which kills bacteria, not the discovery of a new type of bacteria itself.Option C, 'A chemical compound derived from plants,' is incorrect because penicillin is derived from *Penicillium notatum*, a mold, which is a type of fungus, not a plant.Option D, 'An antiseptic solution,' is incorrect because while penicillin is antibacterial and related to antiseptic principles, the passage describes the *discovery* of penicillin as a substance produced by mold, not the creation of an antiseptic solution.  Penicillin is an antibiotic, not an antiseptic solution in the typical sense.All options except A are clearly contradicted or not directly supported by the passage.

It presents a scenario about a historian facing a challenge with fragile papyrus scrolls. \n2. **Correct Answer:** Option B, 'The scrolls were too fragile to be easily examined,' is indeed the correct answer. The passage explicitly states that the scrolls were 'brittle and prone to crumbling,' making them 'impossible to unroll fully and read' without specialized techniques. This directly corresponds to the fragility hindering easy examination.\n3. **Incorrect Options:** Options A, C, and D are clearly incorrect because they are not supported by the passage. \n    * **Option A:**  The passage does not mention anything about the language being undecipherable. The focus is on the physical condition of the scrolls, not the language itself. \n    * **Option C:** The passage mentions the scrolls were 'buried underground,' but not that the location is a 'remote archaeological site' that poses an obstacle to examination. The problem is the fragility, not the location. \n    * **Option D:** The passage is about the initial examination of the scrolls, not about comparing their historical information to other sources. There is no mention of inconsistencies.\n4. **Grammar and Formatting:** There are no grammatical or formatting issues in the question or the options.\n5. **Difficulty Level:** The difficulty level 'Easy' is appropriate.

Option C, 'Drones are transitioning from primarily recreational devices to valuable tools in a variety of professional fields,' accurately captures the central theme of the text, which discusses the shift in drone usage from recreational to professional applications across sectors like farming, construction, and search and rescue. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while it mentions search and rescue, it overemphasizes this single application and doesn't capture the broader shift across 'various professional sectors' mentioned in the text.  \n\nOption B is incorrect as it focuses on specific examples (agriculture and construction) and their benefits (efficiency and safety), rather than the overarching main idea of the transition from recreational to professional use. It's a supporting detail, not the main idea. \n\nOption D is incorrect because it makes an unsupported claim about 'primary beneficiaries' and is also too narrow, focusing only on farmers and construction companies when the text highlights diverse applications beyond just these two. \n\nThere are no grammatical or formatting issues.

Option C, 'To promote scientific careers among students from all backgrounds,' accurately reflects the main point of the text, which highlights Jemison's advocacy for students, especially minority students, to pursue science and technology careers and her belief in universal potential in science. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while Jemison served as a doctor, the text doesn't focus on the challenges doctors face in developing countries. Option B is incorrect because although she served in the Peace Corps, the text's primary focus is not on Peace Corps recruitment but on STEM career encouragement. Option D is incorrect as the text mentions her astronaut career but does not detail the training process. All incorrect options are clearly not the central idea of the passage, making option C the unambiguously correct answer.

The text itself is also easy to understand and focused on a single central idea.\n\n2. **Correct Answer (Option C):** Option C accurately captures the main idea of the text. The passage explicitly states that Thompson's research challenges the perception of orchids as delicate and confined to tropical climates, revealing their surprising adaptability to colder, temperate regions. This aligns perfectly with Option C.\n\n3. **Incorrect Options (A, B, D):**\n    * **Option A:** This option presents the opposite of the main idea. The text *refutes* the notion that orchids are predominantly tropical and delicate. \n    * **Option B:** While antifreeze proteins are mentioned in the text, they are a supporting detail, not the main focus of Thompson's study as presented in the passage. The main focus is the broader finding of orchid resilience in temperate climates, not just the mechanism of antifreeze proteins.\n    * **Option D:** This option is factually incorrect and irrelevant to the main idea. Antifreeze proteins are related to cold survival, not flower vibrancy or diversity. The text doesn't link antifreeze proteins to these floral characteristics.\n\n4. **Grammatical and Formatting Issues:** There are no grammatical errors or formatting problems in the question text or options. \n\n5. **Difficulty Level (Easy):** The difficulty level is appropriately labeled as 'Easy'. The text is short, the main idea is explicitly stated, and the incorrect options are clearly distinguishable from the correct answer. Identifying the main idea in such a straightforward passage is a fundamental reading comprehension skill expected at an 'Easy' level for the SAT."

Options A, C, and D are demonstrably incorrect. Option A makes an unsupported claim about long-term health, which is not discussed in the text.

Option A is too narrow, focusing only on migratory birds and sea turtles, while the text discusses nocturnal animals more broadly. Option B introduces the idea of 'human safety' which is not mentioned in the text, making it irrelevant. Option D contradicts the text by suggesting minimal impact from reducing light pollution, whereas the text implies mitigation is necessary to protect ecosystems.

Option B is explicitly supported by the text, which states Hurston 'immersed herself in documenting the vibrant cultural traditions, folklore, and daily routines of Southern Black communities.' Options A, C, and D are all clearly incorrect based on the passage. Option A is incorrect because the text contrasts Hurston's approach with 'direct political protest.' Option C is incorrect as commercial success is not mentioned in the text. Option D is incorrect because the text explicitly states Hurston focused on the 'rural South,' not urban experiences.

Options B, C, and D are demonstrably incorrect based on the text. Option B is false because the text explicitly mentions newspapers ridiculing the telephone, contradicting 'uniformly supportive.' Option C is incorrect as the text describes the *initial* reception, not rapid popularization.

The passage describes findings, not definitive proof, and 'proportionally larger decrease' is not necessarily 'drastic'. Option C is incorrect as it directly contradicts the passage by stating that all income groups *solely* decreased discretionary spending, while the passage explicitly mentions lower-income groups also reduced essential spending. Option D is incorrect because it introduces an element not discussed in the passage - the effectiveness of government aid programs.

Option B, 'Reading allows individuals to deeply engage with narratives and experience a sense of transformation,' accurately captures the central theme of the text. The passage emphasizes the immersive nature of reading, where the reader 'steps into another world,' becomes 'lost in the narrative,' and experiences a shift in reality. Option A is partially true, as reading can be an escape, but it doesn't fully encompass the depth of engagement and transformation described in the text. Option C is incorrect because the text focuses on the experiential and emotional aspects of reading, not knowledge acquisition. Option D is incorrect as it misrepresents the text's focus, which is clearly on the content and experience of the story, not the physical act of reading. All options are distinct enough, and Option B is definitively the best answer.

The poem is widely interpreted as a metaphorical journey with Death personified as a carriage driver, taking the speaker through stages of life towards eternity. Options A, C, and D are demonstrably incorrect. Option A misinterprets the poem as being about a *past* near-death experience and appreciating everyday life, while the poem is about the journey *with* death. Option C incorrectly frames the poem as a lament about lost youth, missing the broader theme of the journey towards eternity. Option D reduces the profound metaphorical journey to a mere dream, diminishing the poem's deeper meaning. There are no grammatical or formatting issues.

Option B is incorrect because the text suggests the arms' purpose might be related to 'mating or balance', not hunting large prey.

Bumble's 'angry voice,' commands like 'Hold your head up!', and 'steady frown' all contribute to an atmosphere of intimidation. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while Oliver does eat a lot of gruel, the text focuses more on his interaction with Master Bumble and the intimidating atmosphere than on the quantity of food. The amount of food is a detail, not the main idea.\n\nOption B is clearly incorrect as the text explicitly portrays Master Bumble as stern and intimidating, the opposite of 'kind and welcoming.' His actions and words are far from caring.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the workhouse-master does show some timidity and pleads with Bumble ('Please, Bumble, don't bite at him!'), this is a secondary detail.

This directly supports the claim that habitat fragmentation is a more significant factor than severe weather in migration failure. Option A is incorrect because the passage states that 70% of butterflies *successfully* complete the migration, meaning a majority *are able* to complete it, and weather is only responsible for a portion of the failures. Option C is incorrect as the study focuses on migration failure, not overall population decline, and while weather is a factor in migration failure, habitat fragmentation is presented as a more significant factor within the context of this study.

Option C is the most appropriate answer because it presents a balanced and nuanced perspective on the novel concrete. It acknowledges the 'environmental advantages' mentioned in the question stem while also suggesting that 'practical applications may be limited by certain performance characteristics.' This cautious and realistic assessment aligns with the typical tone and reasoning expected in SAT reading comprehension.Option A is too strong and speculative.  The phrase 'ensure that eco-concrete will soon become the primary material' is an overstatement not supported by the limited information in the question stem.  Environmental benefits alone rarely 'ensure' immediate and complete market dominance.Option B is also too definitive and negative.  Stating that eco-concrete is 'unlikely to be used in structural applications due to its inherent weaknesses' is a strong claim that is not supported by the introductory nature of the question stem. The stem only mentions 'novel type of concrete' and 'recycled plastic waste,' not necessarily 'inherent weaknesses.'Option D is overly enthusiastic and absolute.  Claiming that 'current research conclusively demonstrates that eco-concrete is superior to traditional concrete in all aspects' is highly improbable and unrealistic for initial research into a novel material.  'Conclusively demonstrates' and 'superior in all aspects' are excessively strong phrases.There are no grammatical or formatting issues. The difficulty level 'Hard' is appropriate because the question requires nuanced understanding and the ability to differentiate between options based on the strength and certainty of their claims, rather than simple factual recall.

This directly links their daytime behavior to camouflage and protection from these predators. \n\nOption A, 'It is primarily motivated by the need to conserve energy due to limited food availability during the day,' is not mentioned or suggested in the text. The passage focuses solely on camouflage and predation avoidance, not energy conservation or food availability.\n\nOption C, 'It is less effective at night because nocturnal predators rely more on senses other than sight,' while partially related to the text's mention of nocturnal activity and other senses, does not directly answer the question about the *daytime* behavior's motivation. The text uses the contrast with nighttime activity to highlight the *daytime* behavior's purpose related to *visual* predators. Option C shifts the focus to nighttime ineffectiveness, not daytime motivation.\n\nOption D, 'It is a learned behavior, acquired through observing the actions of older, more experienced insects,' is not supported by the text.

The text itself is easy to understand and provides sufficient information to answer the question.\n\n2. **Correctness of Option B:** Option B, 'They amplify weakened light signals to maintain data integrity over long distances,' is indeed the correct answer. The text explicitly states that repeaters 'receive the weakened signal, amplify it back to its original strength, and then retransmit it down the fiber. This process ensures data integrity over vast distances.' Option B accurately reflects this information.\n\n3. **Incorrectness of Other Options:**\n    * **Option A:** 'They convert light signals into electrical signals for easier transmission.' This is incorrect. The text describes optical repeaters dealing with light signals, not converting them to electrical signals. While some repeaters *might* involve electrical components internally, the text focuses on the light signal aspect and amplification, not conversion to a different signal type for transmission.  This option introduces information not present in the text and is therefore incorrect based on the provided passage.\n    * **Option C:** 'They reduce the speed of light signals to prevent signal distortion.' This is incorrect. The text mentions signal weakening (attenuation) and amplification, not signal distortion or speed reduction. Reducing the speed of light is not a function of optical repeaters in the context of mitigating signal attenuation. This option is irrelevant to the text's content.\n    * **Option D:** 'They split the light signal into multiple channels for increased bandwidth.' This is incorrect. The text describes repeaters as amplifying and retransmitting the signal, not splitting it into multiple channels. Splitting signals for bandwidth increase is a different concept (wavelength-division multiplexing) and is not the function of repeaters as described in the text. This option introduces a concept not mentioned in the text and is therefore incorrect.\n\n4. **Grammatical and Formatting Issues:** There are no grammatical or formatting issues in the question text or options. The language is clear and standard.\n\n5. **Difficulty Level:** The 'Hard' difficulty level is arguably appropriate. While the answer is directly stated in the text, students need to carefully read and understand the text to identify the primary function and differentiate it from plausible but incorrect options.  Students must understand the concept of 'primary function' and accurately match it to the text's description, while also eliminating distractors that might sound somewhat related to data transmission but are not the specific function of optical repeaters as described in this context. It requires careful reading and comprehension, making 'Hard' a reasonable assessment, especially within the SAT Reading & Writing context where time management and careful reading are crucial. "

      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and asks about the central idea of the provided text. Option C accurately reflects the main point of the passage, which is that both renewable and nonrenewable energy sources have pros and cons, and a complete evaluation requires considering both short-term and long-term impacts. Options A, B, and D are demonstrably incorrect because they present extreme or unsupported claims. Option A overstates the case against nonrenewable energy by saying they are 'ultimately unsustainable' and that long-term costs *always* outweigh short-term benefits, which is not explicitly stated or implied in the passage. Option B makes an equally absolute and unsupported claim that renewable energy is *always* the more economically sound choice, ignoring the challenges mentioned in the passage like initial costs and intermittency. Option D incorrectly dismisses the validity of studies comparing energy sources, which is contrary to the passage's use of a study as an example. There are no grammatical or formatting issues. The difficulty level 'Hard' is appropriate as it requires understanding nuanced arguments and identifying the central idea rather than simple recall or literal comprehension."

      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and asks for the main idea of the provided text. Option B accurately captures the central theme of the passage, which is that the relationship between social media and political polarization is more complex and less straightforward than initially hypothesized, requiring further research to fully understand. Options A, C, and D are all demonstrably incorrect based on the text. Option A overstates the role of social media echo chambers and claims definitive proof that is not supported by the passage. Option C misrepresents the text by suggesting conclusive evidence of wider exposure on social media compared to traditional media, which is not the text's claim. Option D introduces a comparison and conclusion about traditional media's responsibility that is not discussed or supported in the provided text. There are no grammatical or formatting issues. The difficulty level of 'Hard' is appropriate as identifying the nuanced main idea and eliminating the distractors requires careful reading and comprehension skills typical of harder SAT Reading & Writing questions."

      "is_valid": true,
      "issues": [],
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The question is valid and well-written. Option D is the correct answer because it accurately represents the central idea of the passage: that while the concept of hybrid vehicles is old, their practical success and widespread adoption are recent developments due to technological advancements. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that early hybrid vehicles were more efficient than modern ones; it states they were complex and unreliable. \n\nOption B is a true statement supported by the passage, as complexity and cost did hinder early adoption. However, it is more of a supporting detail explaining *why* early hybrids were not successful, rather than the overarching central idea. Option D is a more comprehensive summary of the passage's main point. \n\nOption C is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that hybrid vehicle technology existed in the 19th century, predating the Toyota Prius. The Prius is credited with popularizing modern hybrids, not initiating the technology itself. \n\nThe difficulty level 'Hard' is appropriate because while the passage is relatively straightforward, discerning the central idea from closely related but less encompassing options like B requires careful reading and understanding of the author's main point."
