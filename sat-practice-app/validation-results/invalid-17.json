      "The option marked as correct (B) is not strictly mathematically correct for the given problem. The question states that the distance is between 3 and 7 miles, inclusive, which means the distance can be exactly 3 miles and exactly 7 miles.  When d=3, C = 2(3) + 5 = 11. When d=7, C = 2(7) + 5 = 19. Therefore, the range of cost should be 11 ≤ C ≤ 19, which includes 11 and 19. Option B, 11 < C < 19, uses strict inequalities and excludes the boundary values of 11 and 19.  Ideally, an option with inclusive inequalities (e.g., 11 ≤ C ≤ 19) should be present for a perfectly valid question. However, among the given options, option B is the closest representation of the correct range, and other options are clearly further from the correct range. Options C and D are wider ranges that contain the correct range, but are not as precise as option B in terms of boundaries. Option A is completely outside the correct range."

The question likely intended to ask for the range of x-values, but incorrectly mentioned 'y-coordinates'.",
      "The options are given in terms of 'v', which is not defined in the question. It is likely intended to represent 'x' or 'y', but this ambiguity adds to the confusion."
