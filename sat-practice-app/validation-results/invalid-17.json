Specifically, the ordered pairs that are supposed to be evaluated are missing.  Therefore, it is impossible to determine which option is correct or to validate the marked answer 'D'.  Assuming that the question intends to be valid and 'D' is meant to be the correct answer, then options I and III should represent ordered pairs that satisfy the inequality $2x + y > 6$, and option II should represent an ordered pair that does not. However, without knowing the actual ordered pairs, we cannot confirm this or deem the question valid.  The question is incomplete and cannot be used in its current form."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "To find the minimum number of titles for Plan A to be less expensive than Plan B, we need to set up an inequality. Let 'x' be the number of titles streamed. The cost of Plan A is $55. The cost of Plan B is $4.50x. We want to find the smallest integer x for which 55 < 4.50x. Dividing both sides by 4.50, we get x > 55 / 4.50, which simplifies to x > 12.22... Since the number of titles must be a whole number, the minimum number of titles is 13. Let's check: For 12 titles, Plan B costs $4.50 * 12 = $54, which is less than $55. For 13 titles, Plan B costs $4.50 * 13 = $58.50, which is more than $55. Therefore, the minimum number of titles is 13, corresponding to option C. Option B, which is marked as correct, is incorrect."

      ],
      "correct_answer": null,
      "explanation": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of hours Leo needs to work after the first 8 hours to save at least $225.First, calculate Leo's earnings for the first 8 hours: 8 hours * $12/hour = $96.Let 'x' be the number of hours Leo works after the first 8 hours. His earnings for these hours will be x hours * $15/hour = $15x.Total earnings for the week are $96 + $15x.Leo saves 75% of his total earnings, so his savings are 0.75 * ($96 + $15x).We want his savings to be at least $225, so we set up the inequality:0.75 * ($96 + $15x) >= $225Divide both sides by 0.75:$96 + $15x >= $225 / 0.75$96 + $15x >= 300Subtract 96 from both sides:$15x >= 300 - 96$15x >= 204Divide both sides by 15:x >= 204 / 15x >= 13.6Since the number of hours must be a whole number, Leo must work at least 14 hours after the first 8 hours.Let's check the provided option A (7 hours):Total earnings = (8 * $12) + (7 * $15) = $96 + $105 = $201Savings = 0.75 * $201 = $150.75. This is less than $225.Let's check if 14 hours after the first 8 hours works:Total earnings = (8 * $12) + (14 * $15) = $96 + $210 = $306Savings = 0.75 * $306 = $229.5. This is at least $225.Therefore, the least number of hours he must work after the first 8 hours is 14.  Option A (7) is incorrect, and none of the provided options are correct. The question is clearly written and makes sense, but the provided correct answer is wrong, making the question invalid as an SAT question with multiple-choice options where only one is supposed to be correct."
