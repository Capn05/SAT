    "question_text": "Impact of Zebra Mussel Introduction on Lake Ecosystem    Ecologists studied the effects of introducing zebra mussels to a freshwater lake in North America. Zebra mussels are an invasive species that filter large quantities of water, affecting the food web. The graph shows the estimated populations of native fish and zebra mussels, as well as the population of other invertebrates in the lake before (2010) and after (2015, 2020) the introduction of zebra mussels in 2012. They concluded that the introduction of zebra mussels negatively impacted native fish populations but benefited zebra mussel populations.  Which choice best describes data from the graph that support the ecologists’ conclusion?",

    "question_text": "Researchers have long believed that plants primarily absorb nutrients from the soil through their roots. However, recent studies suggest that some plants can also absorb nutrients directly from the air through their leaves. These studies propose that atmospheric deposition, such as nitrogen and other minerals carried in rain or dust, can be a significant source of nutrients for certain plant species.  Which finding, if true, would most directly support the studies' claim?",
