However, new discoveries in the mid-20th century, particularly concerning seafloor spreading and paleomagnetism, provided the missing mechanism and compelling evidence.

These models, which rely heavily on past spending patterns and broad economic indicators, tend to overestimate consumer confidence and underestimate the impact of psychological factors like fear of job loss. Bansal and his team propose incorporating sentiment analysis derived from social media data and news reports into forecasting models. They argue that this approach, which captures real-time shifts in public mood, can significantly improve the accuracy of predicting consumer behavior during volatile economic times.
