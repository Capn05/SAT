    "question_text": "Climate change is altering ecosystems worldwide, impacting animal behavior. A recent study by ornithologist Dr. Emily Carter and her team investigated the effects of rising global temperatures on migratory bird patterns in North America. Focusing on the Willow Warbler, a species known for its long-distance migration, Carter's team analyzed migration arrival dates over the past 30 years. Their analysis revealed a consistent trend: Willow Warblers are arriving at their breeding grounds significantly earlier in the spring compared to three decades ago. The team concluded that this shift in migration timing is a direct response to warmer spring temperatures, allowing the birds to exploit earlier insect emergence, a crucial food source for breeding.  Which finding, if true, would most directly support the team's conclusion?",
