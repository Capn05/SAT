Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an hour, and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second pewter porringer of pauper gruel, when Master Bumble, the beadle, thrust himself into the room, and said in an angry voice, 'What's this?  Stop!' 'Gruel, Ma'am,' replied a workhouse-master, surprised at the interruption; 'it's a new boy, Ma'am.' Oliver timidly rose, and bowed to the beadle. 'Hold your head up!' said Master Bumble. 'Answer the master louder!' 'He is frightened,' whimpered the workhouse-master in an agony of terror. 'Please, Bumble, don't bite at him!' Bumble regarded with lofty composure the newcomer's pale face and meagre person; and, turning to the workhouse-master, said, 'You'll fill up his porringers once more, Ma'am?' 'As much as he can eat, Master Bumble?' inquired the master. 'As much as he can eat?' repeated Bumble. 'He'll eat a good deal, I dare say.' Here Mr. Bumble paused; and, regarding Oliver with a steady frown, said, 'You're a nice boy, ain't you?' Oliver cried very bitterly; and the gruel came, and he ate it very quickly.
