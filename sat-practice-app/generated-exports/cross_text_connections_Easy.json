Proponents argue that these technologies are essential for reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change.  They point to advancements in energy storage and grid management that make renewable sources increasingly reliable and cost-effective.  Many governments are now incentivizing renewable energy projects to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. \n \n Text 2 \n \n  While renewable energy is gaining traction, fossil fuels still dominate global energy production.  Critics of a rapid shift to renewables highlight the intermittency of solar and wind power, which can lead to energy supply disruptions.  They also raise concerns about the environmental impact of manufacturing renewable energy infrastructure and the challenges of scaling up these technologies quickly enough to meet global energy demands.  Fossil fuels, despite their environmental drawbacks, remain a dependable and energy-dense source.  \n  <br>\nBased on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?",

    "question_text": "Text 1 \n\nA recent study published in the journal *Nature Astronomy* suggests that the number of potentially habitable exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) could be significantly higher than previously estimated.  Researchers, led by Dr. Aris Papagiannis, analyzed data from the Kepler space telescope and concluded that for every star like our Sun, there may be at least two Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone, where liquid water could exist on the surface. This suggests that our galaxy could be teeming with worlds capable of supporting life.   \n\nText 2  \n\nWhile Dr. Papagiannis and his team's analysis provides exciting new possibilities regarding the prevalence of habitable exoplanets, it is crucial to acknowledge the limitations of current research.  The Kepler data, while extensive, is based on observations of a relatively small portion of our galaxy. Furthermore, habitability as defined by the presence of liquid water is only one factor; other crucial elements for life, such as atmospheric composition and planetary geology, remain largely unknown for these distant worlds.  Therefore, while the Nature Astronomy study is encouraging, definitive conclusions about the abundance of life-supporting planets are premature.\n<br>\n\nWhich of the following is most accurate:",
