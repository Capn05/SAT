The co-formation theory suggested the Earth and Moon formed together from the same protoplanetary disk. The capture theory proposed that the Moon formed elsewhere in the solar system and was later captured by Earth's gravity. However, the fission theory, championed by George Darwin (son of Charles Darwin), gained traction. Darwin hypothesized that a rapidly spinning early Earth ejected material that coalesced to form the Moon.  <u>While seemingly plausible given the Earth-Moon system's angular momentum, this theory struggled to explain the Moon's compositional differences compared to Earth's mantle.</u>  Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?",

However, this perspective often neglects the crucial role of concrete planning and consistent effort. While visualization can be a useful motivational tool, studies in behavioral psychology suggest that it is most effective when coupled with detailed action plans and rigorous self-discipline.
