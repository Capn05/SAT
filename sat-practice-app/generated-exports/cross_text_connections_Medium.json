Researchers hypothesize that the constant barrage of rapidly changing stimuli on digital devices overloads developing neural pathways, hindering the ability to sustain focused attention on a single task.  This suggests a direct causal link: the more time young people spend engaging with screens, the less capable they become of deep, sustained concentration.  \n\nText 2\n\n  While concerns about screen time and attention spans are prevalent, recent research indicates a more nuanced relationship.  A study using EEG measurements found that while prolonged screen exposure *can* lead to attentional shifts, these shifts are primarily towards *selective* attention—the ability to filter out distractions and focus on relevant information within a complex environment. This suggests that screen time may not diminish overall attention, but rather reshape attentional skills in adaptive ways for the digital age. \n  <br>\n\n   Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the assertion in Text 1 that increased screen time directly causes a decrease in the capacity for sustained concentration?",

Initial data suggested a 15% reduction in traffic volume within the zone.  While proponents lauded this as a success in easing gridlock, critics pointed to the increased traffic congestion on roads just outside the pricing zone and argued that the system merely shifted, rather than solved, the problem.  Furthermore, local businesses within the downtown area reported a slight decrease in foot traffic during the initial months following implementation. \n\n #### Text 2  \n \n Many urban centers grapple with traffic congestion, and congestion pricing is often proposed as a solution.  While the Oakhaven example demonstrates a reduction in downtown traffic, a truly effective system must consider the broader transportation network.

Additionally, mitigating any negative economic impact on businesses within the priced zone through targeted support programs is crucial for the long-term viability of such initiatives.  \n <br>\n\n Based on the texts, the authors would most likely agree with which statement about congestion pricing systems like the one in Oakhaven?",
