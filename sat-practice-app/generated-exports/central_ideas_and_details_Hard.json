The library stood, a towering edifice of thought, promising answers to questions unasked.  He entered eagerly, seeking wisdom in the rustling pages. Yet, the more he read, the more vast the ocean of the unknown seemed to stretch before him.  Each answer uncovered spawned a dozen new inquiries, leaving him both enlightened and overwhelmed by the boundless expanse of ignorance he had yet to traverse.  The thirst for knowledge, once a simple longing, now felt like an insatiable fire, fueled by the very knowledge it consumed.  Based on the text, what is a potential downside of pursuing knowledge, as experienced by the individual described?",

She knew, of course, that her refusal had been a disappointment to him; but she also knew that to Horace Trenor disappointment was a necessary stimulant, and that none of her attractions were likely to be heightened by acquiescence.

While some researchers initially hypothesized that social media echo chambers would inevitably deepen partisan divides, recent evidence suggests a more nuanced picture.  A large-scale study, analyzing user behavior across multiple platforms, found that while individuals do tend to consume news from sources aligned with their political views online, the *degree* of this selective exposure is not significantly greater than in traditional media consumption.  Furthermore, the study indicated that social media can also expose individuals to diverse perspectives, albeit often in the context of online debates and discussions that can themselves be polarizing.  Therefore, the role of social media in political polarization appears to be less straightforward than earlier anticipated, and further research is needed to fully understand its complex effects.
