    "question_text": "Dr. Anya Sharma theorizes that non-diegetic music in film, particularly its emotional congruence with a protagonist's internal state, profoundly impacts viewer identification.  Sharma contends that music harmonizing with a protagonist's emotions deepens empathy and strengthens identification.  Conversely, music dissonant with a protagonist's feelings or the conspicuous absence of non-diegetic music during emotionally resonant moments would likely attenuate viewer identification.  For instance, in the concluding scene of Charlie Chaplin’s *City Lights*, the near-total absence of non-diegetic music as the Tramp and the flower girl reunite is notable.  According to Sharma’s theory, this absence of music should affect viewers by __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________",

However, a recent study by consumer behavior researchers at Tech University investigated the impact of different types of endorsements on consumer interest in a new smartphone.  The study compared advertisements featuring celebrity endorsements with advertisements featuring endorsements from everyday smartphone users. Surprisingly, they found that advertisements featuring ordinary users led to a significantly higher level of consumer interest than advertisements featuring celebrities. One possible explanation for this unexpected finding is that consumers may have perceived endorsements from ordinary users as being more  Which choice most logically completes the text?",
