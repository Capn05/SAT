However, recent investigations challenge this notion. Biologist Monica Gagliano and her colleagues conducted a series of experiments with pea plants, *Pisum sativum*, and discovered evidence suggesting a capacity for associative learning in these organisms. The researchers found that pea plants, after being repeatedly exposed to a puff of air immediately followed by an unpleasant dark environment, began to anticipate the unpleasant stimulus. The team claims that this anticipatory behavior indicates that pea plants can learn to associate a neutral stimulus (air puff) with a negative one (darkness), a form of learning previously attributed primarily to animals.
