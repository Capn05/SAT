Early data from the Northeastern United States seemed to confirm this, showing rapid industrialization following railroad network development. However, a closer examination of data from the Southern United States, particularly agricultural regions, revealed a different pattern. Despite the establishment of extensive rail lines, these regions did not experience the same level of economic transformation as the Northeast.

Sharma contends that music harmonizing with a protagonist's emotions deepens empathy and strengthens identification.  Conversely, music dissonant with a protagonist's feelings or the conspicuous absence of non-diegetic music during emotionally resonant moments would likely attenuate viewer identification.  For instance, in the concluding scene of Charlie Chaplinâ€™s *City Lights*, the near-total absence of non-diegetic music as the Tramp and the flower girl reunite is notable.  According to Sharmaâ€™s theory, this absence of music should affect viewers by __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________",
