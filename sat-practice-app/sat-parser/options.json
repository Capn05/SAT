It\u2019 s giv en that the cir cle has its center at -1,1 and that line \ud835\udc61 is tangent t o this cir cle at the point 5,-4.\nTher efore, the points -1,1\u00a0and\u00a0 5,-4 are the endpoints of the r adius of the cir cle at the point of tangency . The slope of a line\nor line segment that contains the points \ud835\udc4e,\ud835\udc4f\u00a0and\u00a0\ud835\udc50,\ud835\udc51\u00a0can be calculated as\u00a0\ud835\udc51-\ud835\udc4f\n\ud835\udc50-\ud835\udc4e. Substituting -1,1 for \ud835\udc4e,\ud835\udc4f and 5,-4 for \ud835\udc50,\ud835\udc51 in the\nexpr ession \ud835\udc51-\ud835\udc4f\n\ud835\udc50-\ud835\udc4e yields -4-1\n5--1 , or\u00a0 -5\n6. Thus, the slope of this r adius is -5\n6. A line that\u2019 s tangent t o a cir cle is perpendicular t o the\nradius of the cir cle at the point of tangency . It follows that line \ud835\udc61 is perpendicular t o the r adius at the point 5,-4, so the slope\nof line \ud835\udc61 is the negativ e recipr ocal of the slope of this r adius. The negativ e recipr ocal of -5\n6 is 6\n5. Ther efore, the slope of line \ud835\udc61 is\n6\n5. Since the slope of line \ud835\udc61 is the same between any two points on line \ud835\udc61, a point lies on line \ud835\udc61 if the slope of the line segment\nconnecting the point and 5,-4 is 6\n5. Substituting choice C, 10,2, for \ud835\udc4e,\ud835\udc4f and 5,-4 for \ud835\udc50,\ud835\udc51 in the expr ession \ud835\udc51-\ud835\udc4f\n\ud835\udc50-\ud835\udc4e yields -4-2\n5-10, or 6\n5.\nTher efore, the point 10,2 lies on line \ud835\udc61.\nChoice A is incorr ect. The slope of the line segment connecting 0,6\n5 and 5,-4 is -4-6\n5\n5-0, or -26\n25, not 6\n5.\nChoice B is incorr ect. The slope of the line segment connecting 4,7 and 5,-4 is -4-7\n5-4, or -11, not 6\n5.\nChoice D is incorr ect. The slope of the line segment connecting 11,1 and 5,-4 is -4-1\n5-11, or 5\n6, not 6\n5.\nQuestion Di\ufb03culty: HardAssessment\nSATT est\nMathDomain\nGeometr y and\nTrigonometr ySkill\nCirclesDi\ufb03culty\n3.12",

Multiplying each side of this\nequation b y \ud835\udc65 yields 21=21\ud835\udc65\n100. Multiplying each side of this equation b y 100 yields 2,100=21\ud835\udc65. Dividing each side of this\nequation b y 21 yields 100=\ud835\udc65. Ther efore, 21 is 21% of 100.\nChoice A is incorr ect.\u00a0 21% of 0 is 0, not 21.

The slope of a line between any\ntwo points \ud835\udc651,\ud835\udc661 and \ud835\udc652,\ud835\udc662 on the line can be calculated using the slope formula \ud835\udc5a=\ud835\udc662-\ud835\udc661\n\ud835\udc652-\ud835\udc651.

This equation can be written in slope-inter cept form\n\ud835\udc66=\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc65+\ud835\udc4f, wher e \ud835\udc5a is the slope of line \u210e and \ud835\udc4f is the y-coor dinate of the y-inter cept of line \u210e. Adding 70 to both sides of\n1\n5\ud835\udc65+1\n7\ud835\udc66-70=0 yields 1\n5\ud835\udc65+1\n7\ud835\udc66=70. Subtr acting 1\n5\ud835\udc65 from both sides of this equation yields 1\n7\ud835\udc66=-1\n5\ud835\udc65+70. Multiplying both\nsides of this equation b y 7 yields \ud835\udc66=-7\n5\ud835\udc65+490. Ther efore, the slope of line \u210e is -7\n5. It\u2019s giv en that line \ud835\udc57 is perpendicular t o\nline \u210e in the xy-plane. Two lines ar e perpendicular if their slopes ar e negativ e recipr ocals, meaning that the slope of the \ufb01rst\nline is equal t o -1 divided b y the slope of the second line. Ther efore, the slope of line \ud835\udc57 is the negativ e recipr ocal of the slope\nof line \u210e. The negativ e recipr ocal of -7\n5 is\u00a0-1\n-7\n5, or 5\n7. Ther efore, the slope of line \ud835\udc57 is 5\n7.\nChoice A is incorr ect. This is the slope of a line in the xy-plane that is par allel, not perpendicular , to line \u210e.\nChoice B is incorr ect. This is the r ecipr ocal, not the negativ e recipr ocal, of -7\n5.\nChoice C is incorr ect.

An equation r epresenting a linear r elationship\ncan be written in the form \ud835\udc66=\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc65+\ud835\udc4f, wher e \ud835\udc5a is the slope and \ud835\udc4f is the y-coor dinate of the y-inter cept of the gr aph of the\nrelationship in the xy-plane. It\u2019 s giv en that for e very incr ease in the v alue of \ud835\udc65 by 1, the v alue of \ud835\udc66 incr eases b y 8. The slope of\na line can be expr essed as the change in \ud835\udc66 over the change in \ud835\udc65. Thus, the slope, \ud835\udc5a, of the line r epresenting this r elationship\ncan be expr essed as 8\n1, or 8. Substituting 8 for \ud835\udc5a in the equation \ud835\udc66=\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc65+\ud835\udc4f yields \ud835\udc66=8\ud835\udc65+\ud835\udc4f.

    "label": "Suspicious\nID: 6cf906f c Answer\nCorr ect A nswer: A\nRationale\nChoice A is the best answer because as used in the text, \" sheltering\" most nearly means pr otectiv e. In the text, the speak er\ndescribes a painting f eaturing a f emale \ufb01gur e. The speak er ultimately conf esses t o falling in lo ve with the woman in the\npainting, who has \" stole[n] awa y\" the speak er\u2019s hear t, but \ufb01rst the speak er describes elements of the painting\u2019 s setting. These\ninclude sterile soil, barr en \ufb01elds with \" no ray / Of hope in a blade of gr een\"\u2014a description that conv eys a mood of melancholy\nand forlornness, possibly r e\ufb02ecting the speak er\u2019s own sadness at falling in lo ve with an image that can \u2019t return the speak er\u2019s\nlove. The text continues b y stating that ther e\u2019s no \" sheltering r oof\" in the painting, e ven though the \" skies ar e hea vy and gr ay,\"\nshowing signs of an impending st orm. Gener ally, a roof\u2019s intended purpose is t o provide pr otection fr om the elements, and in\nthis context, a r oof would off er shelter and pr otection fr om the gathering st orm.\nChoice B is incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests that a r oof would be r estrictiv e\u2014that is, that it would limit or\nrestrain something in some wa y. Although a r oof would pr ovide some co ver from st ormy winds and r ain, it wouldn \u2019t limit the\nwind and r ain, only de\ufb02ect them. Choice C is incorr ect because ther e\u2019s nothing in the text t o suggest that if a \" sheltering r oof\"\nwere present in the painting, it would be aff ectionate, or lo ving and tender . In the text, the immediate context in which the\nword \"sheltering\" appears r efers t o the absence of a r oof that would pr ovide pr otection fr om the oncoming st orm depicted in\nthe painting, not t o the idea that such a shelter would be lo ving and tender if it wer e present. Choice D is incorr ect because in\nthis context, suspicious would mean questionable or dubious, and ther e\u2019s nothing in the text t o suggest that if any r oofs wer e\npresent in the painting, the y would be questionable or cause any suspicion.\nQuestion Di\ufb03culty: EasyAssessment\nSATT est\nReading and W ritingDomain\nCraft and Structur eSkill\nWords in ContextDi\ufb03culty\n1.45",

In other wor ds, despite the fact that r eal star formations ar e intangible, thanks t o Imar a, resear chers can handle\nmodels of star formations t o better understand them.\nChoice A is incorr ect because \"r epeatable \" means can be duplicated or done again, which wouldn \u2019t mak e sense in context.\nThe text indicates that the swirls of gas and dust in which stars form ar e unt ouchable, but that Nia Imar a has pr oduced\ninter activ e models of them. It would ther efore be illogical t o suggest that Imar a belie ves that the formations need not be\nduplicated and then go on t o sa y that she has copied them. Choice B is incorr ect because \" explicable \" means explainable or\nunderstandable, which wouldn \u2019t mak e sense in context. The text does not suggest that Nia Imar a belie ves that star\nformations can be fully explained but r ather that she pr oduced inter activ e models t o physically study them because\nresear chers ar e unable t o touch them dir ectly . Choice C is incorr ect because \"r egrettable \" means distr essing or unfor tunate,\nwhich wouldn \u2019t mak e sense in context. The text does not suggest that Imar a belie ves the r esear chers r egret the star\nformations or \ufb01nd them distr essing, but r ather that she uses inter activ e models t o physically study them.\nQuestion Di\ufb03culty: MediumAssessment\nSATT est\nReading and W ritingDomain\nCraft and Structur eSkill\nWords in ContextDi\ufb03culty\n2.13",
