Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. Entomologist Heather Grab:
- B. Entomologist, Heather Grab,
- C. Entomologist Heather Grab
- D. Entomologist Heather Grab,

### ID: 960dec02 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between a name and title and between a subject and a verb. No punctuation is needed between the proper noun "Heather Grab" and "entomologist," the title that describes Grab. Additionally, no punctuation is needed between the sentence's subject ("Entomologist Heather Grab") and the main verb ("found") that indicates what Grab did.

Choice A is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the subject and the verb. Choice B is incorrect because no punctuation is needed. Setting the entomologist's name off with commas suggests that it could be removed without affecting the coherence of the sentence, which isn't the case. Choice D is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the subject and the verb.

ln a 2016 study, Eastern Washington University psychologist Amani El-Alayli found that, among the study participants who experienced frisson (a physiological response akin to goosebumps or getting the chills) while listening to music, there was one personality trait that they scored particularly ______________ openience.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. high. On
- B. high on;
- C. high on
- D. high on:

### ID: fba5d8d1 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between a main clause and a supplementary phrase. In this choice, a colon is correctly used to mark the boundary between the main clause ("there...on") and the supplementary phrase ("openness to experience") and to introduce the information that identifies which personality trait participants scored especially high on.

Choice A is incorrect because it results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with "on" and separates a necessary preposition from the clause beginning with "there." Choice B is incorrect because a semicolon can't be used in this way to join the main clause ("there...on") and the supplementary phrase ("openness to experience"). A semicolon is conventionally used to join two main clauses, whereas a colon is conventionally used to introduce an element that explains or amplifies the information in the preceding clause, making the colon the better choice in this context. Choice C is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the main clause ("there...on") and the supplementary phrase ("openness to experience").

In 2018, a team of researchers led by Dr. Caitlin Whalen compiled every available measurement of ocean mixing rates from the past two decades. With this novel data set, the team was able to determine how current-driven mixing varies across ________ and what impact it has on the distribution of heat and nutrients in the ocean.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. regions,

B. regions:

C. regions;

- D. regions
ID: 6ea8c23f Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation between coordinates in a sentence. The two elements "how...regions" and "what...ocean" work together as coordinates to complete the description of what the team was able to determine. Because there are only two coordinates in this case (as opposed to a series of three or more), no punctuation is needed between them.

Choice A is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the coordinates "how...regions" and "what... ocean." Choice B is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the coordinates "how...regions" and "what...ocean." Choice C is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the coordinates "how...regions" and "what...ocean."

Researcher Lin Zhi developed a process for increasing the tensile strength—measured in gigapascals, or GPa—of silkworm _________ dissolving and reweaving the silk in a solution of iron metal ions, zinc, and sugar, Zhi increased the amount of force required to stretch it from approximately 0.5 GPa to 2 GPa.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. silk, by

B. silk by

C. silk and by

D. silk. By

ID: aab74a3b Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The independent clauses "researcher Lin Zhi...silk" and "by dissolving...2 GPa" can be grammatically separated by a period. They can stand alone as sentences, and this is the only choice that lets them do that.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a grammar error called a comma splice. "Researcher Lin Zhi....silk" and "by dissolving...2 GPa" are both independent clauses. They need to either be separated with punctuation like a period or a semicolon, or they need to be connected by a comma and a coordinating conjunction like "and." A comma alone isn't enough. Choice B is incorrect. This choice results in a grammar error called a runon sentence. "Researcher Lin Zhi...silk" and "by dissolving...2 GPa" are both independent clauses. They need to either be separated with punctuation like a period or a semicolon, or they need to be connected by a comma and a coordinating conjunction like "and." Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a grammar error called a run-on sentence. "Researcher Lin Zhi...silk" and "by dissolving...2 GPa" are both independent clauses. The coordinating conjunction "and" isn't enough to link them by itself. We need a comma, too.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. novel

B. novel,

C. novel; rather,

D. novel, rather,

### ID: a9e5b788 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice correctly uses a semicolon to join a main clause ("Saville...novel") and a second main clause ("she's...it") preceded by supplementary elements ("rather...narrative").

Choice A is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can't be used in this way to join two main clauses. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, the comma after "novel" can't be used in this way to join the two main clauses.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. information, though;
- B. information, though,
- C. information; though
- D. information though,

### ID: 790fc366 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. This choice uses a semicolon to join two independent clauses ("Nakalembe doesn't just...though" and "she also shares..."). This choice also appropriately includes "though" in the first clause, where it logically belongs.

Choice B is incorrect. This choice results in a grammar error called a comma splice. It incorrectly joins two independent clauses with only a comma instead of a comma and a coordinating conjunction like "and" or "but." "Though" is a transition word, but it's not a coordinating conjunction. Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error. A semicolon can only be used to link two independent clauses. However, if "though" is included in the second clause, it turns the second clause into a dependent clause, so a semicolon can't be used after "information." Choice D is incorrect. This choice results in a grammar error called a comma splice. It incorrectly joins two independent clauses with only a comma and a coordinating conjunction like "and" or "but."

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. however but it
- B. however it
- C. however, it
- D. however. It

### ID: 2bb7416a Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The clause "Like an Elvis impersonator…real thing" and the clause "it is…lookalike" are both independent clauses, so making them into two separate sentences is grammatically correct.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The clause "Like an Elvis impersonator...real thing" and the clause "it is...look-alike" are both independent clauses, so they need to be separated with at least a comma + a coordinating conjunction. This choice provides the coordinating conjunction "but," but it's missing a comma. Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The clause "Like an Elvis impersonator...real thing" and the clause "it is...look-alike" are both independent clauses, so they need to be separated with a semicolon, a dash, a period, or a comma + a coordinating conjunction. Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The clause "Like an Elvis impersonator…real thing" and the clause "it is…look-alike" are both independent clauses, so they need to be separated with at least a comma + a coordinating conjunction.

- A. Panchali a
- B. Panchali, which was a
- C. Panchali, a
- D. Panchali. A

### ID: 0fa289a7 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence ("In... Panchali") and another ("A quiet...time"). The phrase beginning with "a quiet" modifies the subject of the next sentence, "Ray's film."

Choice A is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentences are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.

### ID: 59094d87 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. This choice uses a comma and a coordinating conjunction ("and") to join two independent clauses ("The Tantaquidgeon…Tribe" and "Today…country").

Choice B is incorrect. This choice results in a grammar error known as a run-on sentence. The clauses before and after "Tribe" are both independent, so they need to be separated with some sort of punctuation. Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a grammar error known as a run-on sentence. The clauses before and after "and" are both independent, so they can't be linked with just a conjunction. A comma would also be required. Choice D is incorrect. This choice results in a grammar error called a comma splice.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. exclamation, translated
- B. exclamation and translated
- C. exclamation translated
- D. exclamation. Translated

#### ID: ba8ebf49 Answer

Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence ("The poem...exclamation") and another sentence that begins with a supplementary element ("Translated...poem"). The supplementary element "translated as 'hark!' or 'listen!' in some versions" modifies the subject of the second sentence, "the word" (referring to hwæt).

Choice A is incorrect because it results in a comma splice after "exclamation." A comma can't be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice B is incorrect. Without a comma preceding it, the conjunction "and" can't be used in this way to join sentences. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice after "versions." A comma can't be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences.

- A. geologist,
- B. geologist

- D. geologist:

## ID: 594b4a94 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. "Marie tharp" is essential information that completes the first clause doesn't function without it. So we don't want to separate it with punctuation.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. "The field of geological oceanography owes much to American geologist" is unclear: which geologist are we talking about? We need the "Marie Tharp" for clarity, which means it's essential information and should not be separated by a comma. Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. "The field of geological oceanography owes much to American geologist" is unclear: which geologist are we talking about? We need the "Marie Tharp" for clarity, which means it's essential information and should not be separated by a semicolon. Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error.

- B. playwright, Wakako Yamauchi
- C. playwright Wakako Yamauchi,
- D. playwright Wakako Yamauchi

### ID: 6d4b2e1e Answer

Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of punctuation between titles and proper nouns. No punctuation is needed to set off the proper noun "Wakako Yamauchi" from the title that describes Yamauchi, "pioneering playwright." Because "Wakako Yamauchi" is essential information identifying the "pioneering playwright," no punctuation is necessary.

Choice A is incorrect because no punctuation is needed before or after the proper noun "Wakako Yamauchi." Setting the playwright's name off with commas suggests that it could be removed without affecting the coherence of the sentence, which isn't the case. Choice B is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the title "pioneering playwright" and the proper noun "Wakako Yamauchi." Choice C is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the proper noun "Wakako Yamauchi" and the verb "compares".

- A. Culture:
- B. Culture-
- C. Culture,
- D. Culture

### ID: 109d5bbb Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The text uses a dash to introduce a nonessential element that explains the acronym FESTAC. The dash matches the dash that comes after "known," ending the descriptive aside.

Choice A is incorrect. A colon can only come atter an independent clause, which isn't the case here. Choice C is incorrect. While punctuation is required to set off "or FESTAC…known" from the rest of the sentence, nonessential elements must be separated from the sentence with matching punctuation. Since a dash appears on the other side of the element, we can't use a comma here. Choice D is incorrect. The descriptive aside "or FESTAC...known" is a nonessential element that must be separated with punctuation from the rest of the sentence. This choice fails to add the necessary punctuation before the nonessential element.

- A. system-analyzing
- B. system, analyzing
- C. system. Analyzing
- D. system analyzing

## ID: f45ae404 Answer

#### Correct Answer: C

## Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used correctly to mark the boundary between one sentence ("The city...system") and another ("Analyzing...footage"). The participial phrase beginning with "analyzing" modifies the subject of the second sentence, "the Al algorithm."

Choice A is incorrect. Placing a dash before "analyzing" creates a confusing and ambiguous modifying element ("analyzing...areas") and a comma splice between "areas" and "the Al algorithm." (A comma can't be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences.) Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma can't be used in this way to mark the boundary between sentences. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The sentences ("The city...system" and "analyzing...footage") are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.

On November 2, 1772, amid rising tensions with Great Britain, Boston colonists formed the of Correspondence. By 1774, what had started as a local means of mobilizing support for the Patriot cause had grown into something far more__________ network of such communication among the colonies, helped lay the groundwork for the Continental Congress.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. extensive: a
- B. extensive; a
- C. extensive, it was a
- D. extensive. A

### ID: e9aee0d8 Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of a colon within a sentence. In this choice, the colon is correctly used to introduce the following explanation of what the Patriot cause had grown into by 1774.

Choice B is incorrect because a semicolon can't be used in this way to join the main clause ("what...extensive") and the supplementary element ("a network...Congress"). A semicolon is conventionally used to join two main clauses, whereas a colon is conventionally used to introduce an element that explains or amplifies the information in the preceding clause, making the colon the better choice in this context. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. The addition of the pronoun and verb "it was" forms the start of a new main clause in the sentence, and a comma can't be used in this way to mark the boundary between two main clauses. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with "a network."

In the 1950s, novel audio technologies allowed the addition of another instrument to jazz and swing _____ relatively quiet instrument, its full range of sound was finally audible alongside the blaring brass instruments of the time, allowing flautists like Bennie Maupin and Bobbi Humphrey to perform with other jazz greats.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. music, the flute, a
- B. music. The flute, a
- C. music; the flute, a
- D. music: the flute. A

## ID: 3a2d77d7 Answer

#### Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of punctuation within and between sentences. In this choice, the colon correctly introduces the name of the flute) that novel audio technologies allowed to be added to jazz and swing. In addition, the period is used to correctly mark the boundary between one sentence ("In...flute") and another ("A relatively ... greats").

Choice A is incorrect because it results in a comma can't be used in this way to join two main clauses ("h... quiet instrument" and "its...greats"). Choice B is incorrect. In standard English, it's unconventional to form a sentence in this way with two uncoordinated subjects ("the flute" and "its full range of sound"), and the lack of a clear main subject results in an awkwardly constructed and confusing sentence. Choice C is incorrect. In standard English, it's unconventional to form an independent clause in this way with two uncordinated subjects ("the full range of sound"), and the lack of a clear main subject results in an awkwardly constructed and confusing clause.

Using natural debris, such as dried ______________________ such as treditional art supplies, such as tree glue, Ghanaian artist Ed Franklin Gavua creates his striking Yiiiiikakaii African masks, which he hopes can help viewers rethink how waste is used in their communities.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. leaves, man-made trash:
- B. leaves; man-made trash,
- C. leaves, man-made trash,
- D. leaves; man-made trash;

## ID: 9c3630b9 Answer

#### Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the punctuation of elements in a complex series. It's conventional to use a semicolon to separate items in a complex series with internal punctuation, and in this choice, the semicolon after "leaves" is conventionally used to separate the first item ("natural debris, such as dried leaves") and the second item ("man-made trash, such as plastic bags") in the series of materials used by Gavua. Further, the comma after "trash" correctly separates the noun phrase "man" from the supplementary phrase ("such as plastic bags") that describes it.

Choice A is incorrect because a comma after "leaves" doesn't match the semicolon used later to second and third items in the series ("man-made...bags" and "and...glue"). Additionally, it's not conventional to use a colon in this way to separate a supplementary phrase ("such as plastic bags") from the noun phrase it modifies ("man-made trash"). Choice C is incorrect because a comma after "leaves" doesn't match the semicolon used later to separate the second and third items in the series ("man-made...bags" and "and...glue"). Choice D is incorrect because it's not conventional to use a semicolon in this way to separate a supplementary phrase ("such as plastic bags") from the noun phrase it modifies ("man-made trash").
