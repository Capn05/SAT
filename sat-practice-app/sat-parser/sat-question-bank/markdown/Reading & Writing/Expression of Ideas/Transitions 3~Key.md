3.1

In a heated debate in biogeography, the field is divided between dispersalists and vicariancists. ________ there are those who argue that dispersal is the most crucial determining factor in a species' distribution, and those who insist that vicariance (separation due to geographic barriers) is. Biogeographer Isabel Sanmartín counts herself among neither.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. Furthermore,

B. By contrast,

C. Similarly,

D. That is,

#### ID: e3edc138 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. "That is" logically signals that this sentence clarifies the terms of the scientific debate introduced in the previous sentence by explaining the difference between dispersalists and vicariancists.

Choice A is incorrect because "furthermore" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is merely additional to (and separate from) the information in the previous sentence about the scientific debate. Instead, the information about dispersalists and vicariancists clarifies the terms of that debate. Choice B is incorrect because "by contrast" illogically signals that the information in this sentence contrasts with the previous sentence about the scientific debate. Instead, the information about dispersalists and vicariancists clarifies the terms of that debate. Choice C is incorrect because "similarly" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is merely similar to the information in the previous sentence about the scientific debate. Instead, the information about dispersalists and vicariancists clarifies the terms of that debate.

In 1815, while in exile in Jamaica, Venezuelan revolutionary Simón Bolívar penned a letter praising England's republican government and expressing hope that Latin American nations seeking independence from Spain might achieve something similar. The letter was addressed to a local merchant, Henry Cullen; ______________________________________________________________________________________________ persuade political leaders from England and Europe to support his cause.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

- A. additionally,
- B. ultimately,
- C. accordingly,
- D. consequently,

### ID: 00221c00 Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. "Ultimately" means "in the long run" or "at the highest level." Although Bolivar wrote to a local merchant, his ultimate goal was to send a message to political leaders in Europe. Therefore, "ultimately" fits perfectly in this context.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of an agreeing idea. However, the second part of the sentence actually disagrees with the first part. Bolivar addressed the letter to Cullen, but he was really sending a message to someone else. Notice how the contrast word "though" also acts as a transition between these ideas. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition. Bolivar's writing of the letter to Cullen would not cause him to have a goal of persuading European powers to support him. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition. Bolivar's writing of the letter to Cullen would not cause him to have a qoal of persuading European powers to support him.

In 2009, the Craft and Folk Art Museum in Los Angeles hosted a special exhibition, Sueños/Yume, showcasing the works of local sculptor Dora de Larios. As suggested by the show's title (sueños and yume mean "dreams" in Spanish and Japanese, respectively), de Larios's art reflects a mix of cultural influences. _______ her work is grounded in the artistic traditions of both Mexico and Japan.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

- A. In addition,
- B. In contrast,
- C. Specifically,
- D. Therefore,

### ID: 8e9677e6 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. "Specifically" logically signals that this sentence provides specific, precise details elaborating on the previous sentence's claim that de Larios's art reflects a mix of cultures. This sentence specifies which cultures the previous sentence is referring to: the artistic traditions of both Mexico and Japan.

Choice A is incorrect because "in addition" illogically signation in this sentence is a separate point that follows the previous claim about de Larios's art. Instead, it provides specific details elaborating on that claim. Choice B is incorrect because "in contrast" illogically signals that the information in this sentence contrasts with the previous claim about de Larios's art. Instead, it provides specific details elaborating on that claim. Choice D is incorrect because "therefore" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a result of the previous claim about de Larios's art. Instead, it provides specific details elaborating on that claim.

When one looks at the dark craggy vistas in Hitoshi Fugo's evocative photo series, one's mind might wander off to the cratered surfaces of faraway planets. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ reminding the viewer that each photo is actually a close-up view of a familiar household object: a frying pan.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

- A. Consequently,
- B. Alternatively,
- C. Ultimately,
- D. Additionally,

#### ID: 6e0c60da Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The first sentence describes an experience that the viewer has when they're looking at the photos: they imagine other planets. This sentence describes an experience that the viewer has afterward: the title reminds them that the photos are of frying pans, bringing them back to reality. "Ultimately" is a transition that means "eventually" or "in the end," so it fits the context perfectly.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn't make sense here. The viewer imagining other planets when they're looking at the photos doesn't cause the title to bring them back to reality. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates another option or possibility, which doesn't make sense here. Rather, the viewer has both experiences: first the viewer imagines that they're looking at another planet, and then the title reminds them that it's just a frying pan. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of an agreeing idea. But the viewer's experience in the second sentence is actually the opposite of the viewer's experience in the first sentence. the viewer is imagining that they're seeing a landscape from another planet. In the second sentence, the viewer is reminded that they re looking at a frying pan.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. regardless,

B. admittedly,

C. in other words,

### ID: 2df7b582 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. "In other words" loqically signals that the claim about sensory experience that follows that sensory experience is the source of knowledge-is a restatement of Aristotle's theory from earlier in the sentence.

Choice A is incorrect because "reqardless" illogically signals that the claim about sensory experience that follows is true in spite of Aristotle's theory from earlier in the sentence. Instead, this claim is a restatement of his theory. Choice B is incorrect because "admittedly" illogically signals that the claim about sensory experience that follows is an exception to Aristotle's theory from earlier in the sentence. Instead, this claim is a restatement of his theory. Choice D is incorrect because "meanwhile" illogically signals that the claim about sensory experience that follows is separate from (while occurring simultaneously with) Aristotle's theory from earlier in the sentence. Instead, this claim is a restatement of his theory.

Magnetic levitation (maglev) trains are suspended above a track by powerful electromagnets, reducing friction and thus allowing for much faster speeds. Though maglev advocates in the US have long imagined these trains crisscrossing the country, their dream remains unrealized. __________ of the handful of maglev trains currently in operation, all are in Asia.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. In fact,

B. To that end,

C. Nevertheless,

D. That said,

### ID: 00e0170f Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. This sentence emphasizes just how far maqlev advocates' dreams are from coming true. "In fact" is a transition used to emphasize the truth of a statement that modifies the previous statement and therefore fits perfectly in this context.

Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn't make sense here. Maqlev advocates' dream remaining unrealized would not cause there to be only a few maglev trains, all located in Asia. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition, which doesn't make sense here. In fact, this sentence agrees with the previous sentence—both talk about how maglev trains are far from becoming common in the US. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition, which doesn't make sense here.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. therefore,

B. in fact,

C. moreover,

### ID: c071eca2 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The first sentence tells us that Al-Malaika sometimes used "traditional forms". The second tells us that even when she used traditional forms, Al-Malaika was "breaking new ground". To connect these ideas, we need a contrast word like "but." "Though" is a contrast word similar to "but."

Choice A is incorrect. This isn't a loqical transition. The first sentence tells us that Al-Malaika sometimes used "traditional forms". The second tells us that even when she used traditional forms, Al-Malaika was "breaking new ground". To connect these ideas, we need a contrast word like "but." "Therefore" doesn't show contrast; it shows cause and effect. Choice B is incorrect. This isn't a logical transition. The first sentence tells us that Al-Malaika sometimes used "traditional forms". The second tells us that even when she used traditional forms, Al-Malaika was "breaking new ground". To connect these ideas, we need a contrast word like "but."

A 2017 study of sign language learners tested the role of iconicity of a sign to the thing it represents—in language acquisition. The study found that the greater the iconicity of a sign, the more likely it was to have been learned. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ factor studied: sign frequency.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. In fact,

B. In other words,

C. Granted,

D. As a result,

### ID: 176edca6 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. "Granted" logically signals that the following information-that iconicity is not as highly correlated with acquisition as sign frequency—is true in spite of the information about the correlation between iconicity and acquisition in the previous sentence.

Choice A is incorrect because "in fact" illogically signals that follows either emphasizes or refutes the information in the previous sentence regarding the correlation between iconicity and acquisition. Instead, the sentence that follows provides additional information that is true in spite of the preceding information, it neither emphasizes nor refutes that information. Choice B is incorrect because "in other words" illogically signals that the sentence that follows is a restatement of the information in the previous sentence; instead, the sentence that follows provides additional information that is true in spite of the preceding information. Choice D is incorrect because "as a result" illogically signals that the sentence that follows is a result of the information in the previous sentence reqarding the correlation between iconicity and acquisition; instead, the sentence that follows is true in spite of the preceding information.

"Tulip mania"—the rapid rise and sudden fall of the price of tulip bulbs in seventeenth-century Amsterdam—is often cited as an example of the perils of rampant market speculation. However, recent research has demonstrated that the episode was neither as frenzied nor as disastrous as has been thought. The popular myth surrounding it, ____________ should be regarded with some skepticism.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

- A. for example,
- B. by contrast,
- C. nevertheless,
- D. therefore,

## ID: 9f1a0d91 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. This sentence is arquinq that new evidence contradicting popular beliefs about "tulip mania" should cast doubt on those beliefs. "Therefore" is a cause-and-effect transition, which fits perfectly in this context.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn't make sense here. Skepticism about the popular beliefs is not an example of recent evidence contradicting those beliefs-rather, skepticism is an effect of that recent evidence. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn't disagree with the previous sentence. Instead, it connects a cause from the previous sentence (new evidence that tulip mania was not as disastrous as thought) to an effect (that we should look with skepticism upon the myth about its disastrousness). Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn't disagree with the previous sentence.

The great depths involved—nearly 3,000 km—mark Iceland's volcanoes as extreme outliers; ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 15 km below the surface.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. indeed,

- B. nevertheless,
- C. in addition,
- D. consequently,

## ID: 47e238be Answer

Correct Answer: A

## Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The second part of the sentence says that many volcanoes use shallow pockets of maqma. This is an elaboration of the same underlying idea from the first part of the sentence, which says that the super deep magma of Icelandic volcanoes' makes them outliers. "Indeed" is a transition used for elaborating on the same idea, so it fits the context perfectly.

Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But these two parts of the sentence agree with each other, so "nevertheless" doesn't make sense. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of a new idea. But the second part of the sentence isn't adding a new idea: it's elaborating on the same idea expressed in the first part of the sentence. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn't make sense here. The fact that Iceland's deep-magma volcanoes are outliers doesn't cause many other volcanoes to get fed by shallow pockets of magma.

A. Likewise,

B. Nonetheless,

C. In turn,

D. That is,

## ID: ad729337 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. "Nonetheless" is a transition that indicates disagreement. The first sentence describes the unlikelihood of finding much for critical analysis in Ashbery's poem ("barren terrain"), while the second sentence describes how Berlant did in fact find much to analyze in Ashbery's poem ("fertile ground"), so the transition "nonetheless" fits perfectly.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of a new but similar idea, which doesn't make sense here. The idea in this sentence directly contradicts the idea in the previous sentence. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn't make sense in this context—a poem seeminqly having little opportunity for critical analysis would not cause someone to write an extensive critical analysis (in fact, we might expect the opposite). Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea in other words. But the text isn't restating the first idea here. Instead, it's offering a contradiction to the idea expressed in the first sentence.

### ID: ecb31049 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. Scientists believe in fusion's potential as an energy source, but have struggled to actually make it work-in other words, there is a contradiction between scientists' beliefs and their reality. "That said" is a disagreement transition that works perfectly in this context.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn't make sense here. Scientists not being able to generate extra energy from lab fusion reactions isn't an effect of them believing in fusion's potential. Choice B is incorrect. This transition indicates the addition of another supporting point. But this sentence is not adding a supporting point to the previous sentence-scientists not being able to successfully generate energy from fusion isn't another point in favor of fusion meeting humanity's clean energy needs. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that introduces or elaborates on a particular example. But this sentence doesn't give an example of scientists' belief in fusion's potential to meet humanity's clean energy needs-in fact, it contrasts that optimistic belief with the reality of past failures to successfully employ fusion for energy production.
