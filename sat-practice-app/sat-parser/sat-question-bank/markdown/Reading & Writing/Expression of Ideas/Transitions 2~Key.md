2.1

Most of the planets that have been discovered outside our solar system orbit G-type stars, like our Sun. In 2014, _ researchers identified a planet orbiting KELT-9, a B-type star more than twice as massive and nearly twice as hot as the Sun. Called KELT-9b, it is one of the hottest planets ever discovered.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. likewise,

B. however,

C. therefore,

D. for example,

#### ID: a40c7aa3 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The word "however" logically signation in this sentence about the planet KELT-9b-that it orbits a B-type star-contrasts with the previous information about planets discovered outside our solar system. Most of these planets orbit G-type stars, not B-type stars.

Choice A is incorrect because "likewise" illogically signation about the planet KELT-9b is similar to the previous information about most planets outside our solar system. Instead, it contrasts with that information. Choice C is incorrect because "therefore" illogically signation about the planet KELT-9b is a result of the previous information about most planets outside our solar system. Instead, it contrasts with that information. Choice D is incorrect because "for example" illogically signals that the information about the planet KELT-9b is an example of the previous information about most planets outside our solar system. Instead, it contrasts with that information.

In 1873, Spanish scientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal observed that brain fibers have distinct boundaries with clear end points, a finding that went against earlier assumptions about the brain. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ was a continuous web of fused fibers, not a vast network of distinct, individual cells.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. However,

B. Previously,

C. As a result,

D. Likewise,

#### ID: a819d8b6 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. "Previously" logically signals that the fused fiber theory came before Ramón y Cajal's discovery.

Choice A is incorrect. "However" illoqically signals that the fused fiber theory in this sentence contrasts with the information in the previous sentence. While this theory does contrast with Ramón y Cajal's discovery, the previous sentence concludes by stating that his discovery went against prior assumptions about the brain. The fact that the fused fiber theory was one of those earlier assumptions makes "however" an illogical choice. Choice C is incorrect because "as a result" illogically signals that the fused fiber theory in this sentence was a result of the discovery in the previous sentence. Instead, the fused fiber theory came before Ramón y Cajal's discovery. Choice D is incorrect because "likewise" illogically signals that the fused fiber theory in this sentence was similar to the discovery in the previous sentence. Instead, the fused fiber theory, which came before Ramón y Cajal's discovery, was very different from it.

For years, biologists have experimented with using grime-eating bacteria rather than harsh chemicals to clean artworks, and results have been impressive overall. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ glue, dirt, and other surface impurities without creating harmful byproducts—have proven more effective than traditional chemical cleaning methods.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

- A. However,
- B. In many cases,
- C. As a result,
- D. Additionally,

#### ID: 326017ce Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The first sentence makes the claim that using grime-eating bacteria has led to "impressive results." This sentence supports that claim by describing the specific findings of the biologists' experimentation. The transition "in many cases" fits the context perfectly.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence actually aqrees with the previous sentence. Both claim that grime-eating bacteria are better at cleaning artworks than chemicals. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn't make sense in context. The fact that the results of the experimentation have been impressive overall doesn't cause the bacteria to have proven more effective. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transtion that indicates the addition of a new idea. But this sentence doesn't introduce a new idea. It elaborates on the same idea laid out in the previous sentence by describing the "impressive results" in more detail.

2.4

Alexander Lawrence Posey (1873–1908) varied his focus and tone depending on the genre in which he was writing. In his poetry, he used heartfelt language to evoke the beauty and peacefulness of his natural surroundings; in his journalism, __________ he employed humor and satire to comment on political issues affecting his Muskogee Creek community.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. that is,

B. granted,

C. similarly,

D. by contrast,

### ID: 221ecf0f Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. This sentence compares two examples of Posey's tone: the "heartfelt language" he used in his poetry versus the "humor and satire" he used in his journalism. We know from these descriptions and from the claim in the previous sentence that the two tones are very different from each other. So the transition "by contrast" fits the context perfectly.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea in other words. But the text isn't restating the first example here. Instead, it's offering a second, totally different example. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that means "admittedly" But the text isn't admitting or conceding anything here. Instead, these two examples work together to support the claim made in the first sentence. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of an agreeing idea. But these two examples are intentionally very different from each other, so "similarly" doesn't make sense here.

Okot p'Bitek's poem Song of Lawino (1966) explores postcolonial Ugandan life through the eyes of a woman living in a rural village. With its vibrant imagery, bitingly satiric tone, and dexterous use of traditional Acholi song and phraseology, the poem inspired a generation of East African writers. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ School poets.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. Nevertheless,

B. Fittingly,

C. By comparison,

D. Instead,

### ID: 97e2e364 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. "Fittingly" is a transition that means "appropriately" or "suitably" and it is appropriate that writers who adopted their style from Okot p'Bitek would be known as the Okot School poets.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a disaqreement transition. But this sentence is not disagreeing with anything-rather, it's discussing how it makes sense for those writers who adopted Okot's style to be known as the Okot School poets. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that compares two ideas. But this sentence is not comparing the Okot School poets and their style to Okot's style. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition.

2.6

Because an achiral molecule is symmetrical, flipping it yields a structurally identical molecule. A flipped chiral molecule, can be compared to a glove that has been turned inside out: it produces a structurally inverted molecule rather than an identical one.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. in other words,

B. by contrast,

C. for example,

D. similarly,

### ID: 11df9b99 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. This sentence compares a chiral molecule to an achiral one. It discusses how when a chiral molecule is flipped, it results in something very different than when an achiral molecule is flipped. So the transition "by contrast" fits the context perfectly.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea in different words. But this sentence doesn't restate the same idea as the previous sentence. Instead, it makes a new point about a different type of molecule (chiral instead of achiral). Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that introduces an example, which doesn't make sense here. The second sentence isn't an example of the first sentence's claim about achiral molecules: it actually introduces an entirely different idea that focuses on chiral molecules. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of an agreeing idea. But this sentence shows a contrast with the first sentence-namely, that a chiral molecule acts very differently from an achiral molecule when flipped.

Jhumpa Lahiri's story collection Interpreter of Maladies features about romantic relationships. In "This Blessed House," newlyweds argue over whether to replace items left by the previous owners of their new home . in "A Temporary Matter," a husband and wife attempt to relationship during a four-night blackout.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. Granted,

B. For example,

C. Likewise,

D. Hence,

#### ID: 30438650 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. "Likewise" is a transition that indicates the addition of a new but related idea. In this sentence, the author is providing another similar example to that discussed in the previous sentence. Therefore, "likewise" works best in this context.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that means "admittedly." But the text isn't admitting or conceding anything here. Instead, these two examples work together to support the claim made in the first sentence. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn't make sense here. The second story is not an example of the story in the previous sentence—it's another, similar story. And while both stories exemplify the first sentence in the transition we're looking for isn't actually connected to that sentence. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn't make sense here. The first story didn't result in the events of the second story.

Establishing Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is no easy task. Each month, readings of a single second from atomic clocks around the world are taken and sent to the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in France.

BIPM metrologists perform the meticulous work of assembling these minutely disparate readings into a globally shared time standard.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. There,

- B. In particular,
- C. For example,
- D. Conversely,

### ID: 388b45aa Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. "There" indicates that the work of calculating Coordinated Universal Time takes place at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in France. Because "there" indicates a location, it fits the context perfectly.

Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn't make sense here. This sentence is describing where the work of coordinated Universal Time takes place, not giving an example of the work described in the previous sentence. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn't make sense here. This sentence is describing where the work of coordinating Coordinated Universal Time takes place, not qiving an example of the work described in the previous sentence. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn't disagree with the previous sentence. They both describe the work involved in calculating Coordinated Universal Time.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

- A. Nevertheless,
- B. As a result,

- D. For instance,

## ID: 0c13dea9 Answer

Correct Answer: B

### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. "As a result" indicates that water molecules maintaining their linked structure at high pressures is caused by the strengthening of these water molecules by trimethylamine N-oxide. So the transition "as a result" fits the context perfectly.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn't disagree with the previous one-rather, it's describing an effect of the phenomenon described in the previous sentence. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn't disagree with the previous one; it actually expands on the previous sentence by describing an effect of the strengthened molecules. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn't make sense here. The second sentence doesn't provide an example or instance of the idea in the previous sentence.

"Wishcycling"—putting nonrecyclable items into recycling bins under the mistaken belief that those items can be recycled—ultimately does more harm than good. Nonrecyclable items, such as greasy pizza boxes, can contaminate recyclable materials, rendering entire batches unusable. ________ nonrecyclable products can damage recycling plants' machinery.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. Fittingly,

- B. On the contrary,
- C. Moreover,
- D. Nevertheless,

### ID: eea351c4 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The first sentence tells us that "wishcycling" is harmful, the previous sentence gives us an example, and this sentence gives us another example. So "moreover" – a transition that indicates the addition of another supporting point-fits perfectly here.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that means "appropriately" or "suitably," which doesn't make sense in context. This sentence adds another example of how "wishcycling" is harmful, so we're looking for an addition transition. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence actually agrees with the previous sentence. Both provide examples of how "wishcycling" is harmful. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence actually agrees with the previous sentence. Both provide examples of how "wishcycling" is harmful.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. In sum,

B. Instead,

C. Thus,

D. Additionally,

### ID: 39d1a519 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. "Additionally" logically signals that the painting analysis discussed in this sentence is an additional part of the botany research discussed in the previous sentence. That is, to research which fruits Umbrians grew in the botanist analyzes old paintings in addition to looking at old lists of ingredients.

Choice A is incorrect because "in sum" illogically signals that the painting analysis discussed in this sentence is a concluding summary of the botany research discussed in the previous sentence. Instead, the painting analysis is an additional part of that research. Choice B is incorrect because "instead" illogically signals that the painting analysis discussed in this sentence is an alternative to the botany research discussed in the previous sentence. Rather, the painting analysis is an additional part of that research. Choice C is incorrect because "thus" illogically signals that the painting analysis discussed in this sentence is a result of the botany research discussed in the previous sentence. Instead, the painting analysis is an additional part of that research.

Choice D is the best answer. "Specifically" logically signals that the information in this sentence-that the researchers examined the overhead costs and attendance at events of 22,328 nonprofits-provides specific, precise details elaborating on how the researchers investigated the relationship between nonprofits' spending and performance.

Choice A is incorrect. "Thus" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a result or consequence of the researchers' investigation of nonprofits' spending and performance. Instead, it specifies how they examined that correlation. Choice B is incorrect. "In addition" illogically signation in this sentence is merely an additional fact about the researchers' investigation of nonprofits' spending and performance.

### ID: 25361ec6 Answer

#### Correct Answer: D

### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. "Finally" logicals that the information in this sentence-that scientists found evidence that chondrules were formed by shock waves in nearby nebulae-indicates a conclusion to the scientific debate mentioned in the previous sentences.

Choice A is incorrect because "for example" illogically signals that the information about the evidence for chondrule formation in this sentence exemplifies the information about the scientific debate regarding chondrule formation in the previous sentences. Instead, it indicates a conclusion to the debate. Choice B is incorrect because "therefore" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a result of the previous information about the scientific debate regarding chondrule formation.
