#### Text 1

Microbes are tiny organisms in the soil, water, and air all around us. They thrive even in very harsh conditions. That's why Noah Fierer and colleagues were surprised when soil samples they collected from an extremely cold, dry area in Antarctica didn't seem to contain any life. The finding doesn't prove that there are no microbes in that area, but the team says it does suggest that the environment severely restricts microbes' survival.

#### Text 2

Microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth. So it's unlikely they would be completely absent from Fierer's team's study site, no matter how extreme the environment is. There were probably so few organisms in the samples that current technology couldn't detect them. But since a spoonful of typical soil elsewhere might contain billions of microbes, the presence of so few in the Antarctic soil samples would show how challenging the conditions are.

Based on the texts, Fierer's team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement about microbes?

- A. Most microbes are better able to survive in environments with extremely dry conditions than in environments with harsh temperatures.
- B. A much higher number of microbes would probably be found if another sample of soil were taken from the Antarctic study site.
- C. Microbes are likely difficult to detect in the Antarctic study site because they tend to be smaller than microbes found in typical soil elsewhere.
- D. Most microbes are probably unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site.

ID: 7bf79a90 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about microbes with which Fierer's team (Text 1) and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree. Text 1 states that microbes usually thrive in very harsh conditions, and so Fierer's team was surprised when samples collected from an extremely cold and dry area of Antarctica didn't appear to contain any life. Fierer's team says that though this doesn't conclusively prove there are no microbes in the area, it suggests that microbes would have a notably difficult time surviving in the environment. The author of Text 2 says it's unlikely that there would be no microbes at all in the Antarctic study site from which Fierer's team retrieved soil samples and that there may have been hard-to-detect microbes in the samples. However, the presence of only a few microbes in the Antarctic samples rather than the billions found in a typical soil sample (which would presumably be much easier to detect) would illustrate conditions in the Antarctic soil that make it difficult for microbes to thrive. Since Fierer's team says that the

{1}------------------------------------------------

seeming absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples suggests an unusually harsh environment and the author of Text 2 says that even if there are a few undetectable microbes in the samples, the relatively tiny number of microbes would also suggest an unusually harsh environment, then Fierer's team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree that most microbes are unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site.

Choice A is incorrect. The samples taken by Fierer's team were from an area of Antarctica that is described in part as extremely dry, and these samples didn't appear to have any life. Therefore, even though these samples also came from an extremely cold area, Fierer's team wouldn't argue based on the evidence available that microbes were better able to survive in dry conditions than in areas with harsh temperatures. Moreover, the author of Text 2 says that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth but doesn't compare dry environments and harsh environments. Choice B is incorrect. Nothing in Text 1 indicates that another collection of samples from the Antarctic study site might yield different results from the samples already taken by Fierer's team. The author of Text 2 does state that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth and suggests that new technology may be better able to detect so few microbes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples is evidence of the harsh Antarctic environment. There is no reason to believe that the author of Text 2 thinks that another sample drawn from that same harsh environment would yield a much higher number of microbes. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does speculate that there may have been so few microbes in the Antarctic samples that current technology couldn't detect them, but the author doesn't speculate that this is due to the size of the microbes. Moreover, nothing that Fierer's team says suggests that they are speculating that their samples might have microbes that are smaller than microbes in typical soil samples.

#### Text 1

The idea that time moves in only one direction is instinctively understood, yet it puzzles physicists. According to the second law of thermodynamics, at a macroscopic level some processes of heat transfer are irreversible due to the production of entropy—after a transfer we cannot rewind time and place molecules back exactly where they were before, just as we cannot unbreak dropped eggs. But laws of physics at a microscopic or quantum level hold that those processes should be reversible.

### Text 2

In 2015, physicists Tiago Batalhão et al. performed an experiment in which they confirmed the irreversibility of thermodynamic processes at a quantum level, producing entropy by applying a rapidly oscillating magnetic field to a system of carbon-13 atoms in liquid chloroform. But the experiment "does not pinpoint ... what causes [irreversibility] at the microscopic level," coauthor Mauro Paternostro said.

Based on the texts, what would the author of Text 1 most likely say about the experiment described in Text 2?

- A. It would suggest an interesting direction for future research were it not the physicists who conducted the experiment disagree on the significance of its findings.
- B. It provides empirical evidence that the current understanding of an aspect of physics at a microscopic level must be incomplete.
- C. It is consistent with the current understanding of physics at a microscopic level but not at a macroscopic level.
- D. It supports a claim about an isolated system of atoms in a laboratory, but that claim should not be extrapolated to a general claim about the universe.

## ID: 8de51658 Answer

Correct Answer: B

## Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. Author 1 describes the physicists still can't solve: at a microscopic level, the "laws of physics" suggest that we should be able to reverse processes that are not reversible at a macroscopic level (and, maybe, turn back time!). The experiment confirmed that those processes are not reversible even on the microscopic level, but it didn't explain why. This supports Author 1's point that physicists still don't fully understand how things work at a microscopic level-maybe the laws need to be revised.

Choice A is incorrect. We can't infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to the experiment. Text 2 does name two of the physicists involved in the experiment, but it never suggests that they disagree on anything. Choice C is incorrect. This is the opposite of what the experiment suggests. The experiment confirmed that the macroscopic-level law ("these things can't be reversed-like time") was still true on the microscopic level-meaning

{3}------------------------------------------------

it supports the current understanding of physics at a macroscopic level. Choice D is incorrect. We can't infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to the experiment. Neither text makes this distinction between laboratory findings and the way the universe works in general.

#### Text 1

The live music festival business is growing in event size and genre variety. With so many consumer options, organizers are finding ways to cement festival attendance as a special experience worth sharing. This phenomenon is linked to the growing "experiential economy," where many find it gratifying to purchase lived experiences. To ensure a profitable event, venues need to consider the overall consumer experience, not just the band lineup.

#### Text 2

Music festival appearances are becoming a more important part of musicians' careers. One factor in this shift is the rising use of streaming services that allow access to huge numbers of songs for a monthly fee, subsequently reducing sales of full-length albums. With this shift in consumer behavior, musicians are increasingly dependent on revenue from live performances.

Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?

- A. Consumers are more interested in paying subscription fees to stream music than in attending music festivals in person.
- B. Consumers' growing interest in purchasing experiences is mostly confined to the music industry.
- C. Changing consumer behaviors are leading to changes in music-related businesses.
- D. The rising consumer demand for live music festivals also generates higher demand for music streaming platforms.

#### ID: 82c05b34 Answer

#### Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. Both authors mention how consumer behaviors have shifted, and how this affects different aspects of the music industry. Text I states that consumers enjoy purchasing "lived experiences" and that this influences how organizers design music festivals. Text 2 states that consumers are using services more, and that this reduces album sales and increases the importance of live performances for musicians.

Choice A is incorrect. Neither text claims that consumers prefer streaming to festivals, or that these are mutually exclusive options. Text 1 implies that festivals are popular and Text 2 never suggests that streaming services diminish the demand for live music. Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads Text 1, which identifies music festivals as just one example of a broader trend of purchasing "lived experiences." Text 2 doesn't mention growing interest in purchasing experiences, in the music industry or otherwise. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text establishes a cause/effect relationship between the demand for festivals and the demand for streaming platforms. Text 1 does not mention streaming platforms at all, and Text 2 does not imply that streaming platforms benefit from the popularity of festivals.

#### Text 1

Stage lighting theorist Adolphe Appia was perhaps the first to argue that light must be considered all the various elements of a stage to create a single, unified performance. Researcher Kelly Bremner, has noted that Appia lacked technical expertise in the theater. As a result of Appia's inexperience, Bremner argues, Appia's theory of light called for lighting practices that weren't possible until after the advent of electricity around 1881.

### Text 2

Adolphe Appia was not an amateur in the practice of lighting, Instead, it is exposure to lighting techniques at the time that contributed to his theory on the importance of light. When working as an apprentice for a lighting specialist in his youth, Appia observed the use of portable lighting devices that could be operated by hand. This experience developed his understanding of what was possible in the coordination of elements on the stage.

Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the claim about Appia's level of technical expertise made by Bremner in Text 1?

- A. Many lighting technicians dismissed Appia's ideas about light on the stage.
- B. Appia likely gained a level of technical expertise during his time as an apprentice.
- C. Theater practitioners who worked with Appia greatly admired his work.
- D. Appia was unfamiliar with the use of music and sound in theater.

## ID: f1c9d2c1 Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The author of Text 2 directly contradicts Bremner's claim that Appia lacked technical expertise by stating that Appia was "not an amateur in the practice of lighting." His experience as a lighting specialist's apprentice would have, the author of Text 2 arques, allowed Appia to "[develop] his understanding of what was possible" with the elements of theatrical design.

Choice A is incorrect. Neither text describes how other lighting technicians responded to Appia's ideas. Furthermore, this claim isn't relevant to Bremner's evaluation of Appia's technical expertise. Choice C is incorrect. Neither text mentions anything about the opinions of theater practitioners who worked with Appia, so this answer choice does not relate to the claim about Appia's level of technical expertise made by Bremner in Text 1. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text mentions about Appia's familiarity with or ignorance of the use of music and sound in theater. Both focus on his expertise (or lack thereof) in lighting.

#### Text 1

In 2021, a team led by Amir Siraj hypothesized that the Chicxulub impactor—the object that struck the Yucatán Peninsula sixty-six million years ago, precipitating the mass extinction of the dinosaurs-was likely a member of the class of long-period comets. As evidence, Siraj cited the carbonaceous chondritic composition of samples from the Chicxulub impact crater as well as of samples obtained from long-period comet Wild 2 in 2006.

## Text 2

Although long-period comets contain carbonaceous chondrites, asteroids are similarly rich in these materials. Furthermore, some asteroids are rich in iridium, as Natalia Artemieva points out, whereas long-period comets are not. Given the prevalence of iridium at the crater and, more broadly, in geological layers deposited worldwide following the impact, Artemieva argues that an asteroid is a more plausible candidate for the Chicxulub impactor.

Based on the texts, how would Artemieva likely respond to Siraj's hypothesis, as presented in Text 1?

- A. By insisting that it overestimates how representative Wild 2 is of long-period comets as a class
- B. By arguing that it does not account for the amount of iridium found in geological layers dating to the Chicxulub impact
- C. By praising it for connecting the composition of Chicxulub crater samples to the composition of certain asteroids
- D. By concurring that carbonaceous chondrites are prevalent in soil samples from sites distant from the Chicxulub crater

#### ID: eae66bf9 Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. Siraj's hypothesis is that the Chicxulub impactor was a long-period comet. But Artemieva points to the iridium found in the crater and in "geological layers that were deposited worldwide after the impact" as evidence that it was actually an asteroid, not a long-period comet.

Choice A is incorrect. We can't infer that this is how Artemieva would respond to Siraj's hypothesis. Text 2 never discusses whether Wild 2 is representative of long-period comets in general. Rather, Text 2 presents Artemieva's argument that the Chicxulub impactor was an asteroid, not a long-term comet. Choice C is incorrect. We can't infer that this is how Artemieva would respond to Siraj's hypothesis doesn't make this connection: rather, Siraj hypothesizes that the Chicxulub impactor was a long-term comet. Choice D is incorrect. We can't infer that this is how Artemieva would respond to Siraj's hypothesis. "Soil samples from sites distant from the Chicxulub crater" is too vague. Only soil samples from sites that are connected to the impact in some way are involved in either hypothesis.

#### Text 1

Philosopher G.E. Moore's most influential work entails the concept of common sense. He asserts that there are certain beliefs that all people, including philosophers, know instinctively to be true, whether or not they profess otherwise: among them, that they have bodies, or that they exist in a world with other objects that have three dimensions. Moore's careful work on common sense may seem obvious but was in fact groundbreaking.

## Text 2

External world skepticism is a philosophical stance supposing that we cannot be sure of anything outside our own minds. During a lecture, G.E. Moore once offered a proof refuting this stance by holding out his hands and saying, "Here is one hand, and here is another." Many philosophers reflexively reject this proof (Annalisa Coliva called it "an obviously annoying failure") but have found it a challenge to articulate exactly why the proof fails.

Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to proponents of the philosophical stance outlined in Text 2?

- A. By agreeing with those proponents that Moore's treatment of positions that contradict his own is fundamentally unserious
- B. By suggesting that an instinctive distaste for Moore's position is preventing external world skeptics from constructing a sufficiently rigorous refutation of Moore
- C. By arguing that if it is valid to assert that some facts are true based on instinct, it is also valid to assert that some proofs are inadequate based on instinct
- D. By pointing out that Moore would assert that external world skepticism is at odds with other beliefs those proponents must unavoidably hold

## ID: 03080769 Answer

#### Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. According to the author of Text 1, Moore's definition of common sense-things we instinctively know are true—includes the belief that we all "exist in a world with other objects." The author of Text 1 describes this notion as both "obvious" and "groundbreaking." So it's safe to infer that the author would observe that Moore would respond to external world skeptics by arguing that since everyone instinctively knows that things exist outside of their own minds, then external world skepticism must be wrong.

Choice A is incorrect. We can't infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to external world skeptics. If anything, the author of Text I seems to agree with Moore. Choice B is incorrect. We can't infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to external world skeptics. The author of Text 1 never mentions external world skeptics

{9}------------------------------------------------

directly, let alone why they have a hard time refuting Moore's position. Choice C is incorrect. We can't infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to external world skeptics. Text 1's presentation of Moore's concept of common sense only includes the idea that some facts are true based on instinct—it doesn't mention the idea that some proofs are inadequate based on instinct.

#### Text 1

Because literacy in Nahuatl script, the writing system of the Aztec Empire, was lost after Spain invaded central Mexico in the 1500s, it is unclear exactly how meaning was encoded in the script's symbols. Although many scholars had assumed that the symbols signified entire words, linguist Alfonso Lacadena theorized in 2008 that they signified units of language smaller than words: individual syllables.

### Text 2

The growing consensus among scholars of Nahuatl script is that many of its symbols could signify either words or syllables, depending on syntax and content at any given site within a text. For example, the symbol signifying the word huipil (blouse) in some contexts could signify the syllable "pil" in others, as in the place name "Chipiltepes." Thus, for the Aztecs, reading required a determination of how such symbols functioned each time they appeared in a text.

Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely characterize Lacadena's theory, as described in Text 1?

A. By praising the theory for recognizing that the script's symbols could represent entire words

B. By arguing that the theory is overly influenced by the work of earlier scholars

C. By approving of the theory's emphasis on how the script changed over time

D. By cautioning that the theory overlooks certain important aspects of how the script functioned

# ID: 12d81fc1 Answer

### Correct Answer: D

### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. Lacadena's theory is that Nahuati script symbols signified syllables, but the consensus described in Text 2 is that they can signify either symbols or full words, depending on the context. So the author of Text 2 would likely consider Lacadena's theory too simplistic: it's missing the importance of the context in determining the meaning of a symbol.

Choice A is incorrect. This conflicts with Text 1's description of Lacadena's theory is that Nahuatl script symbols signified syllables. Choice B is incorrect. This conflicts with Text I's description of Lacadena's theory. Text 1 states that Lacadena's theory differed from what earlier scholars believed. Choice C is incorrect. We can't infer that this is how the author of Text 2 would characterize Lacadena's theory. Neither text mentions how or even if the script changed over time.

Text 1

Many studies in psychology have shown that people seek out information even when they know in advance that they have no immediate use for it and that they won't directly benefit from it. Such findings support the consensus view among researchers of curiosity: namely, that curiosity is not instrumental but instead represents a drive to acquire information for its own sake.

Text 2

While acknowledging that acquiring information is a powerful motivator, Rachit Dubey and colleagues ran an experiment to test whether emphasizing the usefulness of scientific information could increase curiosity about it. They found that when research involving rats and fruit files was presented as having medical applications for humans, participants expressed greater interest in learning about it than when the research was not presented as useful.

Based on the texts, how would Dubey and colleagues (Text 2) most likely respond to the consensus view discussed in Text 1?

- A. By suggesting that curiosity may not be exclusively motivated by the desire to merely acquire information
- B. By conceding that people may seek out information that serves no immediate purpose only because they think they can use it later
- C. By pointing out that it is challenging to determine when information-seeking serves no goal beyond acquiring information
- D. By disputing the idea that curiosity can help explain apparently purposeless information-seeking behaviors

# ID: 27d9bb69 Answer

Correct Answer: A

# Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The researchers in Text 2 recognize that acquiring information is a powerful motivator, but showed that this motivation can still be affected by other factors, like whether or not the information is expected to be useful or not. This suggests that other desires may play a part in driving people to acquire information.

Choice B is incorrect. The consensus view in Text 1 is that people acquire information regardless of whether they think they can use it later. Dubey and colleagues acknowledge this fact (so they don't claim people seek out information "only" because it might be useful later). Choice C is incorrect. This choice misreads the results of Dubey and colleagues' study in Text 2. Neither text discusses the difficulty of determining the motivationseeking. Choice D is incorrect. This choice contradicts Text 2, which starts with Dubey and colleagues "acknowledging that acquiring information is a powerful motivator" (i.e., agreeing that curiosity explains the

{12}------------------------------------------------

seeking of apparently purposeless information). The research in Text 2 simply suggests that more than just curiosity can motivate information-seeking behavior when the information has a purpose.

Text 1

Polar bears sustain themselves primarily by hunting seals on the Arctic sea ice, but rising ocean temperatures are causing the ice to diminish, raising concerns about polar bear population declines as these large predators' sealhunting habitats continue to shrink. A 2020 study examining polar bear populations across the Arctic concluded that populations affected by sea-ice loss are at great risk of extinction by the end of the twenty-first century. Text 2

Monitoring carried out by researchers from the Norwegian Polar Inat the polar bear population on the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard remains stable and well nourished despite rapidly declining sea ice in recent years. The researchers attribute this population's resilience in part to a shift in feeding strategies: in addition to hunting seals, the Svalbard polar bears have begun relying on a diet of reindeer meat and birds' eggs.

Based on the texts, how would the researchers in Text 2 most likely respond to the conclusion presented in the underlined portion of Text 1?

- A. By noting that it neglects the possibility of some polar bear populations adapting to changes in their environment
- B. By suggesting that it is likely incorrect about the rates at which warming ocean temperatures have caused sea ice to melt in the Arctic
- C. By asserting that it overlooks polar bear populations that have not yet been affected by loss of seal-hunting habitats
- D. By arguing that it fails to account for polar bears' reliance on a single seal-hunting strategy

# ID: f52cc78c Answer

Correct Answer: A

### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. Text 2 describes how the Svalbard polar bears have adapted to the loss of sea ice by diversifying their diet and feeding on reindeer and seabird eggs, resulting in a "stable and well nourished" population despite environmental challenges. This counters the underlined claim that polar bears facing a loss of sea ice are at "great risk of extinction" by the end of the century.

Choice B is incorrect. Text 2 does not challenge the fact that sea ice is rapidly declining in the Arctic due to warming ocean temperatures. In fact, it states that the Svalbard polar bears have faced "rapidly declining sea ice in recent years." Choice C is incorrect. The claim in Text 1 is specific to polar bear populations affected by the loss of seal hunting habitats, so unaffected populations are irrelevant to the claim. Also, Text 2 doesn't mention any polar bear populations that haven't yet been affected by loss of seal hunting habitats. It focuses on a population that has been affected by sea-ice loss but has managed to survive and thrive nevertheless. Choice D is incorrect. Text 2 doesn't imply that polar bears rely on a single seal-hunting strategy. In fact, the researcher in Text 2 would say that Text 1 fails to account for polar bears' ability to develop other hunting strategies and food sources.

#### Text 1

It seems clear that emotional contagion (the unintentional transfer of an emotional state from one person to another) requires physical interaction and the observation of body language. After all, research shows that talking to someone who is smiling and expressing positive feelings often causes people to respond in a comparably positive way. Similarly, displays of nervous fidgeting have been found to prompt others to begin behaving more nervously, too.

2.10

### Text 2

ln an experiment using a social networking service, Zeyao Yang and Emilio Ferrara found evidence of emotional contagion in text-based online interactions. The researchers discovered that reading social media posts that expressed a positive outlook led people to make more positive posts themselves, with a negative emotional tone led people to make more negative posts.

Based on the texts, what would the researchers in Text 2 most likely say about the claim underlined in Text 1?

It perpetuates a flawed understanding of emotional contagion, because there isn't enough evidence to suggest that A. smiling is a sign of emotional contagion.

lt reflects an incomplete view of emotional contagion, because this phenomenon can occur even without in-person B. interaction.

It's fairly persuasive, because studies attempting to identify emotional contagion in situations without in-person C. interaction have thus far yielded unclear results.

It's mostly accurate, because the social networking study confirmed that emotional contagion primarily occurs in D. response to negative emotions like nervousness.

# ID: faee8ec7 Answer

Correct Answer: B

{16}------------------------------------------------

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it represents how the researchers in Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 begins by asserting that the unintended transfer of feelings from one person to another, known as emotional contagion, seems to rely on both people being physically present and able to observe body language. Text 1 then references research that supports this assertion. Text 2 describes an experiment conducted by the researchers Yang and Ferrara in which they found evidence of emotional contagion in the absence of physical interaction, namely through textbased interactions on social media. The researchers in Text 2 wouldn't completely agree with what is asserted in the underlined portion of Text 1 (that emotion seems to require physical proximity), because their study, which used a social media networking service, found that physical interaction isn't the only way that emotional contagion can take place. Thus, the researchers in Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1 by stating that it reflects an incomplete view of emotional contagion, because the phenomenon can occur without an in-person interaction.

Choice A is incorrect. Although the researchers in Text 2 would likely agree that the underlined statement in Text 1 perpetuates a flawed conclusion that emotional contagion requires physical interaction, Text 2 doesn't address what the researchers thought about smiling as a sign of emotion. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers in Text 2 wouldn't say that the underlined claim in Text 1 is fairly persuasive. According to Text 2, the researchers conducted a study that found emotional contagion didn't require physical interaction, because they found evidence of it in text-based online interactions. Choice D is incorrect because neither of the texts claim that emotional contagion primarily occurs when a person is exposed to negativity.

### Text 1

Graphic novels are increasingly popular in bookstores and libraries, but the classified as literature. By definition, literature tells a story or conveys meaning through language only; graphic novels tell stories through illustrations and use language only sparingly, in captions and dialoque. Graphic novels are experienced as series of images and not as language, making them more similar to film than to literature.

#### Text 2

Graphic novels present their stories through both language and images. Without captions and dialoque, readers would be unable to understand what is depicted in the illustrations: the story results from the interaction of text and image. Moreover, Alison Bechdel's Fun Home and many other graphic novels feature text that is as beautifully written as the prose found in many standard novels. Therefore, graphic novels qualify as literary texts.

Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the overall argument presented in Text 1?

A. By asserting that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes

B. By acknowledging that the author of Text 1 has identified a flaw that is common to all graphic novels

By suggesting that the story lines of certain graphic novels are more difficult to understand than the author of Text 1 C. claims

D. By agreeing with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren't as well crafted as most literary works are

# ID: 059f7201 Answer

Correct Answer: A

{18}------------------------------------------------

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the argument presented in Text 1. In arquing that graphic novels shouldn't be classified as literature and are more comparable to film, Text 1 claims that language plays a relatively limited role in graphic novels: images, not language, are the primary means by which graphic novels tell their stories, and lanquage is used "only sparingly"—that is, comparatively very little—in the form of captions and dialogue. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that language in graphic novels is as equally vital for conveying meaning as images are, since without captions and dialogue, readers wouldn't be able to make sense of the narrative. Moreover, the author of Text 2 argues that are "beautifully written" are whose use of language is as accomplished as any standard novel. Because Text 1 arguage is subordinate to images in graphic novels, whereas Text 2 highlights how language is an essential component of a graphic novel's storytelling, it can reasonably be inferred that the author of Text 2 would say that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes.

Choice B is incorrect. Although Text 1 indicates that graphic novels shouldn't be classified as literature based on their limited use of language, there's no indication that the author of Text 1 considers this limited use of language as a flaw, just that it doesn't fit the particular definition of "literature" proposed in the text 1 had suggested that their use of language was a common flaw of graphic novels, the author of Text 2 emphasizes how many graphic novels are "beautifully written," and would therefore say that their use of language is exemplary, not that it is flawed. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 doesn't claim that the story lines of graphic novels are generally relatively easy to understand; in addition, Text 2 arques that given their dependence on the interaction of image and text, the stories of graphic novels would be incomprehensible if their captions and dialogue were removed, not that the story lines of some graphic novels are more difficult to understand than Text 1 acknowledges. Choice D is incorrect because the author of Text 1 doesn't imply that graphic novels aren't well crafted, only that they use language too sparingly to fit the definition of "literature" and that their use of images to convey stories makes them more comparable to film than to literature. Even if the author of Text 1 had implied that most graphic novels aren't well crafted, Text 2 refers to the fact that many graphic novels are as beautifully written – that is, well crafted—as many standard novels; thus, it wouldrit be accurate to say that the author of Text 2 would agree with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren't well crafted.
