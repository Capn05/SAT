#### Text 1

Public policy researcher Anthony Fowler studied the history of elections in Australia, a country that requires citizens to vote. Fowler argues that requiring citizens to vote leads to a significant increase in voters who would otherwise not have the time or motivation to vote. Thus, election results in countries that require citizens to vote better reflect the preferences of the country as a whole.

### Text 2

Governments in democratic countries function better when more people vote. However, forcing people to vote may have negative consequences. Shane P. Singh and Jason Roy studied what happens when a country requires its citizens to vote. They found that when people feel forced to spend less time looking for information about their choices when voting. As a result, votes from these voters may not reflect their actual preferences.

Based on the texts, how would Singh and Roy (Text 2) most likely respond to the research discussed in Text 1?

- A. Only countries of a certain population size should implement mandatory voting.
- B. People who are forced to vote are likely to become politically engaged in other ways, such as volunteering or running for office.
- C. Requiring people to vote does not necessarily lead to election outcomes that better represent the preferences of the country as a whole.
- D. Countries that require voting must also make the process of voting easier for their citizens.

### ID: 02fd3da7 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. Text 1 claims that mandatory voting results in elections that "better reflect the preferences of the country." Singh and Roy disagree. They claim that more voters doesn't equal more quality votesâ€”instead, they argue that forced voting may lead to less-informed votes that "may not reflect [voters'] actual preferences."

Choice A is incorrect. Neither text mentions the population size of countries that require voting, or how that might affect election outcomes. Choice B is incorrect. Neither text discusses the effects of mandatory voting on other forms of political engagement. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text discusses the ease or difficulty of the voting process in countries that require voting.

#### Text 1

Dance choreographer Alvin Ailey's deep admiration for jazz music can most clearly be felt in the rhythms and beats his works were set to. Ailey collaborated with some of the greatest jazz legends, like Charles Mingus, Charlie Parker, and perhaps his favorite, Duke Ellington. With his choice of music, Ailey helped bring jazz to life for his audiences.

#### Text 2

Jazz is present throughout Ailey's work, but it's most visible in Ailey's approach to choreography. Ailey often incorporated improvisation, a signature characteristic of jazz music, in his work. When managing his dance company, Ailey rarely forced his dancers to an exact set of specific moves. Instead, he encouraged his dancers to let their own skills and experiences shape their performances, as jazz musicians do.

Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?

A. Dancers who worked with Ailey greatly appreciated his supportive approach as a choreographer.

- B. Ailey's work was strongly influenced by jazz.
- C. Audiences were mostly unfamiliar with the jazz music in Ailey's works.
- D. Ailey blended multiple genres of music together when choreographing dance pieces.

#### ID: 8d802289 Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. Author 1 states that Ailey had a "deep admiration for jazz music" and that he "helped bring jazz to life for his audiences." Author 2 states that "Jazz is present throughout Ailey's work." While the authors name different aspects of Ailey's work as the most influenced by jazz, they agree that jazz was a strong influence.

Choice A is incorrect. This isn't something that either text claims. Neither text mentions how Ailey's dancers felt about his approach as a choreographer, so we have no evidence that either author would agree with this. Choice C is incorrect. This isn't something that either text claims. Neither text mentions how familiar audiences were with any aspect of Ailey's works, so we have no evidence that either author would agree with this. Choice D is incorrect. This isn't something that either text claims. Neither text mentions any genre of music other than jazz, so we have no evidence that either author would agree with this.

#### Text 1

Historians studying pre-Inca Peru have looked to ceramic vessels to understand daily life among the Moche people. These mold-made sculptures present plants, animals, and human faces in precise ways-vessels representing human faces are so detailed that scholars have interpreted facial markings to represent scars and other skin irregularities. Some historians have even used these objects to identify potential skin diseases that may have afflicted people at the time.

### Text 2

Art historian and archaeologist Lisa Trever has argued that the interpretation of Moche "portrait" vessels as hyper-realistic portrayals of identifiable people may inadvertently disregard the creativity of the objects' creators. Moche ceramic vessels, Trever argues, are artworks in which sculptors could free their imagination, using realistic objects and people around them as inspiration to explore more abstract concepts.

Based on the texts, what would Lisa Trever (Text 2) most likely say about the interpretation the underlined portion of Text 1?

- A. Depictions of human faces are significantly more realistic than depictions of plants and other animals are.
- B. It is likely that some depictions of human faces with extensive markings are intended to portray the same historical individual.
- C. Some vessels may have been damaged during their excavation and thus provide little insight into Moche culture.
- D. Markings on depictions of human faces are not necessarily intended to portray particular details about the physical appearance of individuals.

ID: 835d1ae6 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. Trever thinks that the "hyper-realistic portrayal of identifiable people" interpretation ignores the sculptors' imagination and creativity. We can infer that Trevor thinks the facial markings on the sculptures may not have represented real skin blemishes on real people.

Choice A is incorrect. The text gives us no reason to think that Trever would respond to the underlined interpretation in this way. Neither text compares the depictions of human faces to the depictions of plants or animals, so we have no basis to draw this conclusion. Choice B is incorrect. The text gives us no reason to think that Trever would respond to the underlined interpretation in this way. There's nothing in either text about multiple depictions representing the same person, so we have no basis to draw this conclusion. Choice C is incorrect. The text gives us no think that Trever would respond to the underlined interpretation in

{3}------------------------------------------------

this way. Neither text mentions the state of the vessels (damaged or intact), so we have no basis to draw this conclusion.

#### Text 1

Italian painters in the 1500s rarely depicted themselves in their work. Even more rare were self-portrait paintings that portrayed the artist as a painter. At the time, painting was not yet respected as a profession, so painters mostly chose to emphasize other qualities in their self-portraits, like their intellect or social status. In the city of Bologna, the first artist to depict themself painting was a man named Annibale Carracci. A painting of his from around 1585 shows Carracci in front of an easel holding a palette.

### Text 2

In their self-portraits, Bolognese artists typically avoided referring to the act of painting until the mid-1600s. However, Lavinia Fontana's 1577 painting, Self-Portrait at the Keyboard, stands out as the earliest example of such a work by an artist from Bologna. Although the artist is depicted playing music, in the background, one can spot a painting easel by a window.

Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?

- A. Carracci and Fontana were among the most well-respected painters in Bologna at the time.
- B. The depiction of Fontana in Self-Portrait at the Keyboard was intended to underscore the artist's creativity.
- C. Fontana likely inspired the reference to an easel and palette in Carracci's painting.
- D. Self-Portrait at the Keyboard was painted earlier than Carracci's painting and also refers to the artist's craft.

### ID: 81da17d3 Answer

Correct Answer: D

### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The author of Text 2 states that Fontana's painting, which depicts a painting easel in the background, was made in 1577, eight years before Carracci's painting. Therefore, they might argue that Caracci was not "the first artist" to depict themself as a painter.

Choice A is incorrect. The texts don't support this choice. Neither text mentions the reputation or status of either Carracci or Fontana. Choice B is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does not comment on the intention or meaning of Fontana's self-depiction in Self-Portrait at the Keyboard. This choice also holds little connection to the underlined claim. Choice C is incorrect. The texts don't support this choice. The author of Text 2 does not suggest any inspirational relationship between Fontana and Carracci. The author of Text 2 is concerned with showing that Fontana's painting is the earliest example of an artist referring to painting in their self-portrait, but makes no mention of her influence on others.

### Text 1

Today the starchy root cassava is found in many dishes across West Africa, but its rise to popularity was slow. Portuguese traders brought cassava from Brazil to the 1500s. But at this time, people living in the capitals further inland had little contact with coastal communities. Thus, cassava remained relatively unknown to most of the region's inhabitants until the 1800s.

1.5

## Text 2

Cassava's slow adoption into the diet of West Africans is mainly due to the nature of the crop itself. If not cooked properly, cassava can be toxic. Knowledge of how to properly prepare cassava needed to spread before the food could grow in popularity. The arrival of formerly enslaved people from Brazil in the 1800s, who brought their knowledge of cassava and its preparation with them, thus directly fueled the spread of this crop.

Based on the texts, the author of Text 1 and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement?

- A. Cassava did not become a significant crop in West Africa until long after it was first introduced.
- B. Several of the most commonly grown crops in West Africa are originally from Brazil.
- C. The climate of the West African coast in the 1500s prevented cassava's spread in the region.
- D. The most commonly used methods to cook cassava today date to the 1500s.

### ID: c68ceeff Answer

### Correct Answer: A

### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. Text 1 states that cassava's "ise to popularity was slow" in West Africa. Text 2 also describes cassava's "slow adoption into the diet of West Africans." While the two texts identify different causes for this slow adoption, both agree that cassava took a lonq time to catch on.

Choice B is incorrect. This isn't something that either text claims. Cassava is the only crop discussed in the passages, so we have no basis to draw conclusions about what the authors might say about "several" crops. Choice C is incorrect. This isn't something that either text claims. Neither text mentions the West African coast," so we have no evidence that either would agree with this. Choice D is incorrect. This isn't something that either text claims. The 1500s were when cassava was brought to West Africa, but neither text describes how cassava is cooked, nor do they make any claims about when cooking methods were developed.

### Text 1

On April 26th, 1777, Sybil Ludington rode 40 miles by horse through Putnam County, New York, to gather up local militia. British forces were burning nearby Danbury, Connecticut, and Ludington wanted to rally rebel troops to meet them. Although she was only 16 years old at the time, her brave feat made Ludington one of the American Revolution. Since then, Ludington has been widely celebrated, inspiring postage stamps, statues, and even children's TV series.

### Text 2

Historian Paula D. Hunt researched the life and legacy of Sybil Ludington but found no evidence for her famous ride. Although many articles and books have been written about Ludington, Hunt believes writers may have been inventing details about Ludington as they retold her story. Ludington is revered by Americans today, but there simply isn't a strong historical record of her heroic ride.

Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?

- A. Sybil Ludington was crucial to the outcome of the Revolutionary War.
- B. Historians have confirmed which route Sybil Ludington took.
- C. Sybil Ludington was likely not a real person.
- D. Many people have come to admire the story of Sybil Ludington's ride.

## ID: 5a4b147c Answer

Correct Answer: D

### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. Both authors agree that Ludington's story has been widely celebrated and revered by Americans, even if they disagree on its accuracy. Text 1 states that Ludington has inspired postage stamps, statues, and TV series, and Text 2 states that many articles and books have been written about her. Thus, both authors acknowledge the popularity of Ludington's story.

Choice A is incorrect. Neither author claims that Ludington had a significant impact on the war. Text 1 doesn't mention how Ludington's ride affected the war overall, and Text 2 suggests that Ludington's ride may have been exaggerated or invented over time. Choice B is incorrect. Neither author claims that Ludington's route has been verified by historians. Text 1 claims she rode 40 miles through Putnam County, but doesn't cite any sources for this information, while Text 2 suggests the ride may not have even happened. Choice C is incorrect. This choice misreads text 2. Neither author claims that Ludington was not a real person, only that her ride may not have happened. Both authors seem to treat Ludington as a genuine historical figure.

### Text 1

For decades, bluegrass musicians have debated whether their genre should exclude influences from mainstream genres such as rock. Many insist that bluegrass is defined by its adherence to the folk music of the US South, out of which bluegrass emerged. Such "purists," as they are known, regard the recordings of Bill Monroe, which established the bluegrass sound in the 1940s, as a standard against which the genre should still be measured.

## Text 2

Bluegrass isn't simply an extension of folk traditions into the era of recorded music. In reality, Bill Monroe created the bluegrass sound in the 1940s by combining Southern folk music with commercial genres that had arisen only a few decades before, such as jazz and the bluegrass has always been a mixed genre, contemporary bluegrass musicians should not be forbidden from incorporating into it influences from rock and other mainstream genres.

Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely regard the of bluegrass purists, as described in Text 1?

A. As inconsistent, since bluegrass purists themselves enjoy other musical genres

B. As unrealistic, since bluegrass purists have no way of enforcing their musical preferences

C. As shortsighted, because bluegrass could enlarge its audience by including influences from mainstream genres

D. As illogical, because the purists overlook crucial aspects of how the bluegrass sound first originated.

## ID: 9645f55e Answer

Correct Answer: D

### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. According to Author 1, the "purists" argue that bluegrass should stick to its folk music roots. But Author 2 points out that this isn't how blueqrass emerged. it actually got its sound from a mix of folk, jazz, and blues.

Choice A is incorrect. There's nothing in Text 2 about what other genres the purists enjoy, so this inference about Author 2's views isn't supported. Choice B is incorrect. There's nothing in Text 2 about whether or how purists can enforce their preferences, so this inference about Author 2's views isn't supported. Choice C is incorrect. There's nothing in Text 2 about the size of bluegrass's audience, so this inference about Author 2's views isn't supported.

### Text 1

Most scientists agree that the moon was likely formed after a collision between Earth and a large planet named Theia. This collision likely created a huge debris field, made up of material from both Earth and Theia. Based on models of this event, scientists believe that the moon was formed from this debris over the course of years.

1.8

### Text 2

Researchers from NASA's Ames Research Center used a computer to model how the moon could have formed. Although simulations of the moon's formation have been done in the past, the team from NASA ran simulations that were much more detailed. They found that the formation of the moon was likely not a slow process that took many years. Instead, it's probable that the moon's formation happened immediately after impact, taking just a few hours.

Which choice best describes a difference in how the author of Text 1 and the author of Text 2 view the evidence for the formation of the moon?

- A. The author of Text 1 argues that the formation of the moon occurred much earlier than the author of Text 2 argues.
- B. The author of Text 1 suggests there is more evidence confirming the existence of Theia than the author of Text 2 suggests.
- C. The author of Text 1 claims that the moon's surface is more similar to Earth's surface than the author of Text 2 claims.
- D. The author of Text 1 believes that the moon formed more slowly than the author of Text 2 believes.

### ID: dc043599 Answer

Correct Answer: D

### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. Text 1 states that the moon was formed from the course of thousands of years," while Text 2 states that the moon's formation happened "immediately after impact, taking just a few hours." This shows a clear difference in how the authors view the evidence for the speed of the moon's formation.

Choice A is incorrect. While Text 2 suggests that the moon formed over "just a few hours" and Text 1 says it took "thousands of years," neither one mentions when that formation occurred. Choice B is incorrect. While Theia isn't mentioned in Text 2, neither text describes or disputes of Theia's existence. Choice C is incorrect. Neither text makes any claims about the similarity or difference between the moon's surface and Earth's surface.

### Text 1

Literary scholars have struggled with the vastness of Nigerian writer Wole Soyinka's collective works of drama (spanning over 20 plays in total). It is best, however, to understand Soyinka's body of work as a dramatist chronologically. Soyinka's progression as a playwright can be considered to fall into three periods, with each one representing a particular thematic and stylistic cohesion: the 1960s, the two decades between 1970 and 1990, and lastly, from roughly 1990 onwards.

## Text 2

It is tempting to impose a linear sense of order on the expanse of Wole Soyinka's body of work as a dramatist. However, critics who have considered Soyinka's plays to fit nee phases overlook potential commonalities in Soyinka's work that span across these phases. Additionally, this view may discount significant differences in the styles and content of plays written around the same time.

Which choice best describes a difference in how the author of Text 1 and the author of Text 2 view the study of Soyinka's works of drama?

- A. While the author of Text 1 believes that thinking about Soyinka's works of theater in phases is useful, the author of Text 2 views such an approach as limiting.
- B. Although the author of Text 1 claims that Soyinka's style as a dramatist has evolved over time, the author of Text 2 argues that Soyinka's style has remained consistent throughout his career.
- C. The author of Text 1 considers Soyinka's plays to showcase his strongest writing, whereas the author of Text 2 believes that Soyinka's poetry is where he is most skilled.
- D. The author of Text 1 argues that Soyinka's early plays were his most politically charged, whereas the author of Text 2 claims that Soyinka's most recent plays are the most politicized.

## ID: 2c50ed1a Answer

Correct Answer: A

### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The author of Text 1 states that Soyinka's progression as a playwright can be considered to fall into three periods, implying that this is a helpful way to understand his works. The author of Text 2, on the other hand, challenges this view and says that it overlooks potential commonalities and differences in Soyinka's work across what Text 1 calls distinctive stylistic phases.

Choice B is incorrect. This choice overstates the central claim of Text 2. The author of Text 2 argues against the chronological progression supported in Text 1, but does not go so far as to say that Soyinka's style remained consistent. In fact, Text 2 points out "significant differences in styles and content" among Soyinka's plays. Choice C

1.9
{10}------------------------------------------------

is incorrect. Neither of the texts mention Soyinka's poetry, nor do they rank his dramatic writing relative to his other work. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text discusses the political aspects of Soyinka's plays, nor do they make any claims about whether they have changed over time.

### Text 1

In a study of insect behavior, Samadi Galpayage and colleagues presented bumblebees with small wooden balls and observed many of the bees clinging to, rolling, and dragging the objects. The researchers provided no external rewards (such as food) to encourage these interactions. The bees simply appeared to be playingâ€”and for no other reason than because they were having fun.

1.10

#### Text 2

Insects do not have cortexes or other brain areas associated with emotions in humans. Still, Galpayage and her team have shown that bumblebees may engage in play, possibly experiencing some kind of positive emotional state. Other studies have suggested that bees experience negative emotional states (for example, stress), but as Galpayage and her team have acknowledged, emotions in insects, if they do indeed exist, are likely very rudimentary.

Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined portion of Text 1?

- A. By objecting that the bees were actually experiencing a negative feeling akin to stress rather than a positive feeling
- B. By arguing that some insects other than bumblebees may be capable of experiencing complex emotional states
- C. By pointing out that even humans sometimes struggle to have fun while engaging in play
- D. By noting that if the bees were truly playing, any positive feelings they may have experienced were probably quite basic

## ID: 22105871 Answer

#### Correct Answer: D

## Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The author of Text 2 agrees with the author of Text 1 that bumblebees may engage in play and possibly experience some kind of positive emotional state. However, the author of Text 2 also qualifies this claim by stating that emotions in insects, if they do exist, are "likely very rudimentary"

Choice A is incorrect. While Text 2 states that other studies might indicate "negative emotional states" in bees, it does not contradict the findings from the Galpayage studyâ€”that the bees might have been having fun. Choice B is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does not mention or imply that any insects, including bumblebees, are capable of experiencing complex emotional states. The author of Text 2 states that if insects do feel emotions are "likely very rudimentary." Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does not compare or contrast the behavior or emotions of insects and humans, and neither does the author of Text 1.

## Text 1

Although food writing is one of the most widely read genres in the United States, literary scholars have long neglected it. And within this genre, cookbooks attract the least scholarly attention of all, regardless of how well written they may be. This is especially true of works dedicated to regional US cuisines, whose complexity and historical significance are often overlooked.

## Text 2

With her 1976 cookbook The Taste of Country Cooking, Edna Lewis popularized the refined Southern cooking she had grown up with in Freetown, an all-Black community in Virginia. She also set a new standard for cookbook writing: the recipes and memoir passages interspersing them are written in prose more elegant than that of most novels. Yet despite its inarguable value as a piece of writing, Lewis's masterpiece has received almost no attention from literary scholars.

Based on the two texts, how would the author of Text 1 most likely regard the situation presented in the underlined sentence in Text 2?

- A. As typical, because scholars are dismissive of literary works that achieve popularity with the general public
- B. As unsurprising, because scholars tend to overlook the literary value of food writing in general and of regional cookbooks in particular
- C. As justifiable, because Lewis incorporated memoir into The Taste of Country Cooking, thus undermining its status as a cookbook
- D. As inevitable, because The Taste of Country Cooking was marketed to readers of food writing and not to readers of other genres

# ID: 159ef46d Answer

## Correct Answer: B

## Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. Text 1 states that literary scholars ignore regional cookbooks most of all, even when they have historical significance and are well written. So the author of Text 1 wouldn't be surprised that scholars ignored Edna Lewis's cookbook.

Choice A is incorrect. We can't infer that this is how the author of Text 1 would regard the situation. Text 1 never suggests that scholars are dismissive of popular works in general. Instead, Text 1 says that scholars ignore food writing specifically, despite its popularity-and despite the fact that it can be historically significant and complex. Choice C is incorrect. We can't infer that this is how the author of Text 1 would regard the situation. Text 1 never suggests that elements of other genres should be kept out of cookbooks. Choice D is incorrect. We can't infer that

1.11

this is how the author of Text 1 would regard the situation. Text 1 never discusses how food writing is or should be marketed.

### Text 1

Some animal species, like the leopard, can be found in many kinds of areas. On the other hand, tropical mountain bird species tend to be limited in the types of spaces they can call home. This is because many mountain bird species are only able to survive at very specific elevations. Over time, these species have likely become used to living at a specific temperature. Therefore, these species struggle to survive at elevations that are warmer or colder than they are used to.

## Text 2

A new study reviewed observations of nearly 3,000 bird species to understand why tropical mountain bird species live at specific elevations. They noted that when a mountain bird species was found in an area with many other bird species, it tended to inhabit much smaller geographic areas. It is thus likely that competition for resources with other species, not temperature, limits where these birds can live.

Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?

- A. Tropical mountain bird species are restricted in where they can live.
- B. Scientists have better tools to observe tropical mountain birds than they did in the past.
- C. Little is known about how tropical mountain birds build their nests.
- D. Tropical mountain bird species that live at high elevations tend to be genetically similar.

## ID: 7b55e895 Answer

## Correct Answer: A

## Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. Both texts state that tropical mountain bird species have limited ranges or habitats, although they disagree on the reason for this. Text 1 claims that temperature is the main factor that determines where these birds can live, while Text 2 claims that competition with other species is the main factor. However, both texts agree that these birds are not able to survive in many kinds of areas.

Choice B is incorrect. Neither text mentions that scientists use to observe these birds, either now or in the past. Choice C is incorrect. Neither text mentions anything about how these birds build their nests. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text provides any information about the genetic similarity of these birds, so we have no evidence that either author would agree with this statement.

## Text 1

American sculptor Edmonia Lewis is best known for her sculptures from history and mythology, such as The Death of Cleopatra and Hagar. Although Lewis sculpted other subjects, her career as a sculptor is best represented by the works in which she depicted these historical and mythical themes.

1.13

## Text 2

Art historians have typically ignored the many portrait busts created. Lewis likely carved these busts (sculptures of a person's head) frequently throughout her long career. She is known for her sculptures that represent historical figures, but Lewis likely supported herself financially by carving portrait busts for acquaintances who paid her to represent their features. Thus, Lewis's portrait busts are a central aspect of her career as a sculptor.

Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?

- A. Lewis's portrait busts have overshadowed her other work.
- B. The Death of Cleopatra is Lewis's most famous piece.
- C. Sculpting representations of historical figures was a short-lived trend.
- D. Lewis's works are varied in the subjects they depict.

## ID: c106b9f7 Answer

## Correct Answer: D

## Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. Author 1 acknowledges that Lewis sculpted other subjects besides historical and mythical figures, suggesting a variety of subjects depicted. Author 2 mentions that Lewis carved portrait busts as well as historical sculptures, which also implies variation among Lewis's subjects.

Choice A is incorrect. Neither text suggests that Lewis's portrait busts have received more attention or appreciation than her other work. Author 1 briefly mentions her "other works," but mostly focuses on her historical and mythical works. Author 2 states that art historians have typically ignored her portrait busts, which suggests that they haven't overshadowed her other work. Choice B is incorrect. Neither text explicitly states that The Death of Cleopatra is Lewis's most famous piece. Author 1 mentions it as one example of her historical works, but does not single it out as being more important or influential than Hagar. Author 2 does not mention it at all, focusing instead on her portrait busts. Choice C is incorrect. This choice isn't supported by the texts. Neither text suggests that sculpting historical figures was a trend that faded quickly.

### Text 1

A team led by Bernardo Strassburg has found that rewilding farmland (returning the land to its natural state) could help preserve biodiversity and offset carbon emissions. The amount of farmland that would need to be restored, they found, is remarkably low. Rewilding a mere 15% of the world's current farmland would prevent 60% of expected species extinctions and help absorb nearly 299 gigatons of carbon dioxide-a clear win in the fight against the biodiversity and climate crises.

## Text 2

While Strassburg's team's findings certainly offer encouraging insight into the potential benefits of rewilding, it's important to consider potential effects on global food supplies. The researchers suggest that to compensate for the loss of food-producing land, remaining farmland would need to produce even more food. Thus, policies focused on rewilding farmland must also address strategies for higher-yield farming.

Which choice best describes a difference in how the author of Text 1 and the author of Text 2 view Strassburg's team's study?

- A. The author of Text 2 approaches the study's findings with some caution, whereas the author of Text 1 is optimistic about the reported potential environmental benefits.
- B. The author of Text 2 claims that the percentage of farmland identified by Strassburg's team is too low for rewilding to achieve meaningful results, whereas the author of Text 1 thinks the percentage is sufficient.
- C. The author of Text 2 believes that the results described by Strassburg's team are achievable in the near future, whereas the author of Text 1 argues that they likely aren't.
- D. The author of Text 2 focuses on rewilding's effect on carbon emissions, whereas the author of Text 1 focuses on its effect on biodiversity.

## ID: 88bb0f6f Answer

#### Correct Answer: A

## Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. Text 1 is extremely positive about Strassburg's team's findings, calling the potential results "a clear win in the fight against the biodiversity and climate crises." Text 2 is not as positive, arguing that while the findings point to "potential benefits," we also need to consider the "potential effects on global food supplies."

Choice B is incorrect. This isn't a difference between the two views. Text 1 does present the 15% number as enough to achieve meaningful results, but that s not what Text 2 takes issue with: rather, Text 2 argues that we need to consider the effect that rewilding this much farmland would have on food supplies. Choice C is incorrect. This isn't

1.14

{17}------------------------------------------------

a difference between the two views. Neither text mentions the timeline the results described by Strassburg's team. Choice D is incorrect. This isn't a difference between the two views. Text 1 focuses on rewilding's effects on both carbon emissions and biodiversity. Text 2 doesn't focus on rewilding's effect on carbon emissions at all. Instead, it focuses on a third factor: global food supplies.

### Text 1

Flamingos are known for their vibrant pink coloring, but they're actually born with gray feathers. Their pink color comes from eating brine shrimp, but brine shrimp aren't naturally pink either. Animals carotenoids, the pigments that provide the pink hue. The algae that brine shrimp feed on, however, can produce these pigments. Thus, the pinker the flamingo, the more shrimp it has eaten.

1.15

## Text 2

Ecologist Juan Amat has found that flamingos apply a kind of make themselves appear pinker. A gland near their tail contains pigments that come from the food they eat. When the flamingos groom themselves using the i feathers become pinker. Flamingos may do this to improve their success during mating season, when they would beneft from looking pinker.

Based on the texts, how would the ecologist in Text 2 most likely respond to the author's conclusion in Text 1?

A. By emphasizing that flamingos' tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers are

- B. By claiming that the coloring of flamingos' feathers doesn't change significantly enough for most observers to notice
- C. By pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn't the only thing that influences flamingos' coloring
- D. By arquing that flamingos' diet doesn't include much shrimp except during mating season

### ID: ed52a093 Answer

Correct Answer: C

{19}------------------------------------------------

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it describes how the ecologist in Text 2 would most likely respond to the author's conclusion in Text 1 based on the information provided. The author of Text 1 states that the pink color of flamingo feathers comes from pigments carried by the bring flamingos consume. The author of Text 1 concludes that this means that a flamingo that is pinker than another flamingo must have eaten more shrimp. However, according to Text 2, ecologist Juan Amat has found that flamingos can also affect how pink they look through grooming, when they move ingested pigments from a gland near the tail to their feathers. This indicates that not all the pigments available from the shringo has eaten automatically end up coloring the flamingo's feathers; some may or may not be applied later. Since grooming is also a factor, the ecologist (Amat) in Text 2 would most likely respond to the conclusion in Text 1 that pinker flamingos have eaten more shrimp by pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn't the only thing that influences flamings' coloring.

Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 states that the ecologist has found that flamingos can move pigments to their feathers from a gland near their tail, there is no indication that their tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers. Moreover, the point that tail feathers are pinker than other feathers wouldn't logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamings's coloring. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos' feathers do sometimes look pinker and gives no indication that this change in color is particularly subtle. Moreover, the point that most observers wouldn't logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo's coloring. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the ecologist would arque about flamingos' shrimp consumption. Although Text 2 indicates that that flamingos may make themselves look pinker during mating season, this is addressed in terms of grooming habits; apart from referring to food as a source of pigments, Text 2 doesn't discuss the diet of flamingos at all.
