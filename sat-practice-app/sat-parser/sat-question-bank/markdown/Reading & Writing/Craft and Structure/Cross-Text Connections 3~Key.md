#### Text 1

In 1916, H. Dugdale Sykes disputed claims that The Two Noble Kinsmen was coauthored by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher. Sykes felt Fletcher's contributions to the play were obviousâ€”Fletcher had a distinct style in his other plays, so much so that lines with that style were considered sufficient evidence of Fletcher's authorship. But for the lines not deemed to be by Fletcher, Sykes felt that their depiction of women indicated that their author was not Shakespeare but Philip Massinger.

#### Text 2

Scholars have accepted The Two Noble Kinsmen as coauthored by Shakespeare since the 1970s: it appears in all major one-volume editions of Shakespeare's complete works. Though scholars disagree about who wrote what exactly, it is generally held that on the basis of style, Shakespeare wrote all of the first act and most of the last, while John Fletcher authored most of the three middle acts.

Based on the texts, both Sykes in Text 1 and the scholars in Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement?

- A. John Fletcher's writing has a unique, readily identifiable style.
- B. The women characters in John Fletcher's plays are similar to the women characters in Philip Massinger's plays.
- C. The Two Noble Kinsmen belongs in one-volume compilations of Shakespeare's complete plays.
- D. Philip Massinger's style in the first and last acts of The Two Noble Kinsmen is an homage to Shakespeare's style.

#### ID: 97e5bf55 Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. Text 1 states that Sykes felt Fletcher's contributions to the play were obvious because he had a distinct style in his other plays. Text 2 states that scholars qenerally agree "on the basis of style" that Fletcher wrote most of the three middle acts. Both texts imply that Fletcher's writing has a unique, readily identifiable style that can be used to distinquish his work from others.

Choice B is incorrect. While Text 1 refers to the women in Massinger plays, neither text compares the women of Fletcher's plays to the women of Massinger's plays. Text 2 doesn't mention Massinger at all. Choice C is incorrect. Text 1 states that Sykes disputed that Shakespeare coauthored the play, and implied that it was coauthored by Fletcher and Massinger instead. Sykes, therefore, would disagree that The Two Noble Kinsmen belongs in a Shakespeare compilation. Choice D is incorrect. Text 1 doesn't suggest that Massinger was inspired by Shakespeare, and Text 2 doesn't mention Massinger at all.

#### Text 1

Growth in the use of novel nanohybrids-materials created from the conjugation of multiple distinct nanomaterials, such as iron oxide and gold nanomaterials conjugated for use in magnetic imaging-has outpaced studies of nanohybrids' environmental risks. Unfortunately, risk evaluations based on nanohybrids' constituents are not reliable: conjugation may alter constituents' physiochemical properties such that innocuous nanomaterials form a nanohybrid that is anything but.

## Text 2

The potential for enhanced toxicity of nanohybrids relative to the toxicity of constituent nanomaterials has drawn deserved attention, but the effects of nanomaterial conjugation vary by case. For instance, it was recently shown that a nanohybrid of silicon dioxide and zinc oxide preserved the desired optical transparency of zinc oxide nanoparticles while mitigating the nanoparticles' potential to damage DNA.

Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the assertion in the underlined portion of Text 1?

- A. By concurring that the risk described in Text 1 should be evaluated but emphasizing that the risk is more than offset by the potential benefits of nanomaterial conjugation
- B. By arguing that the situation described in Text 1 may not be representative but conceding that the effects of nanomaterial conjugation are harder to predict than researchers had expected
- C. By denying that the circumstance described in Text 1 is likely to occur but acknowledging that many aspects of nanomaterial conjugation are still poorly understood
- D. By agreeing that the possibility described in Text 1 is a cause for concern but pointing out that nanomaterial conjugation does not inevitably produce that result

ID: 105ea6de Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The author of Text 2 acknowledges that nanohybrids may be more toxic than their constituent parts, but also provides an example of a nanohybrid that has reduced toxicity compared to its components: silicon dioxide and zinc oxide together have all the benefits of zinc oxide namoparticles without any of the DNA harm zinc oxide has on its own.

Choice A is incorrect. While the author of Text 2 qives an example of a nanohybrid that isn't as toxic as its constituent parts, they don't arque that the benefit outweighs the risk. They merely arque that "the effects of nanomaterial conjugation vary by case." Choice B is incorrect. The author of Text 2 states that the effects of nanomaterial conjugation "vary by case" and that the attention that their potential toxicity has drawn is warranted. If the situation in Text 1 weren't representative, then there would be less attention to the potential

{2}------------------------------------------------

danger of these materials. Furthermore, neither passage suggests that researchers had expected that they could predict the effects of nanomaterial conjugation. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 agrees that the potential toxicity of nanohybrids "has drawn deserved attention," so they aren't denying the problem.

#### Text 1

Africa's Sahara region-once a lush ecosystem-began to dry out about 8,000 years ago. A change in Earth's orbit that affected climate has been posited as a cause of desertification, but archaeologist David Wright also attributes the shift to Neolithic peoples. He cites their adoption of pastoralism as a factor in the region drying out: the pastoralists' livestock depleted vegetation, prompting the events that created the Sahara Desert.

## Text 2

Research by Chris Brierley et al. challenges the idea that Neolithic peoples contributed to the Sahara's desertification. Using a climate-vegetation model, the team concluded that the end of the region's humid period occurred 500 years earlier than previously assumed. The timing suggests that Neolithic peoples didn't exacerbate aridity in the region but, in fact, may have helped delay environmental changes with practices (e.g., selective grazing) that preserved vegetation.

Based on the texts, how would Chris Brierley (Text 2) most likely respond to the discussion in Text 1?

- A. By pointing out that given the revised timeline for the Sahara's humid period, the Neolithic peoples' mode of subsistence likely didn't cause the region's desertification
- B. By claiming that pastoralism was only one of many behaviors the Neolithic peoples took part in that may have contributed to the Sahara's changing climate
- C. By insisting that pastoralism can have both beneficial and deleterious effects on a region's vegetation and climate
- D. By asserting that more research needs to be conducted into factors that likely contributed to the desertification of the Sahara region

## ID: c4737d6a Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. Brierley et al.'s research directly challenges Wright's claim that pastoralism turned the Sahara into a desert, suggesting that turned arid 500 years earlier than previously thought, pastoral practices may have actually "preserved veqetation" rather than depleting it.

Choice B is incorrect. Brierley et al.'s research actually disputes that any Neolithic peoples' behaviors, including pastoralism, could have contributed to the Sahara's changing climate. In fact, their research implies that the Neolithic peoples' practices did not "exacerbate aridity" (i.e., make things worse), but may have slowed environmental changes. Choice C is incorrect. Brierley et al.'s research does not acknowledge that pastoralism can have deleterious (i.e., negative) effects on a region's veqetation and climate. It only describes one possible beneficial effect: preserving vegetation through practices like selective grazing. Choice D is incorrect. Brierley

{4}------------------------------------------------

et al.'s research does not call for more research into factors that likely contributed to the desertification of the Sahara region.

#### Text 1

Soy sauce, made from fermented soybeans, is noted for its umami-one of the five basic tastes along with sweet, bitter, salty, and sour-was formally classified when its taste receptors were discovered in the 2000s. In 2007, to define the pure umami flavor scientists Rie Ishii and Michael O'Mahony used broths made from shiitake mushrooms and kombu seaweed, and two panels of Japanese and US judges closely agreed on a description of the taste.

## Text 2

A 2022 experiment by Manon JÃ¼nger et al. led to a greater understanding of soy sauce's flavor profile. The team initially presented a mixture of compounds with low molecular weights to taste testers who found it was not as salty or bitter as real soy sauce. Further analysis of soy sauce identified proteins, including dipeptides, that enhanced umami flavor and also contributed to saltiness. The team then made a mix of 50 chemical compounds that re-created soy sauce's flavor.

Based on the texts, if Ishii and O'Mahony (Text 1) and JÃ¼nger et al. (Text 2) were aware of the findings of both experiments, they would most likely agree with which statement?

- A. On average, the diets of people in the United States tend to have fewer foods that contain certain dipeptides than the diets of people in Japan have.
- B. Chemical compounds that activate both the umami and salty taste receptors tend to have a higher molecular weight than those that only activate umami taste receptors.
- C. Fermentation introduces proteins responsible for the increase of umami flavor in soy sauce, and those proteins also increase the perception of saltiness.
- D. The broths in the 2007 experiment most likely did not have a substantial amount of the diped a key part in the 2022 experiment.

#### ID: a87c3925 Answer

#### Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. Ishii and O'Mahony were trying to isolate the pure umami flavor, while JÃ¼nger was trying to recreate soy sauce, which has a mix of flavors that includes umami. Accordingly, the broths from Text 1 are not described as having any soy sauce in them-just "shiitake mushrooms and kombu seaweed." So they probably don't have as much of the dipeptides described in Text 2, which were found to be a key part of soy sauce's umami-ness and its saltiness.

Choice A is incorrect. Neither text supports this. Neither text gets into the diets of people in the United States, nor the diets of people in Japan. Choice B is incorrect. Neither text supports this. Text 2 does talk about the

{6}------------------------------------------------

molecular weights of chemical compounds, but there isn't enough information provided about molecular weights in Text 1 to make an inference about what the scientists in Text 1 would say. Choice C is incorrect. Neither text supports this. Text 1 briefly mentions that soy sauce is "made from fermented soybeans" but it never claims that fermentation is responsible for its flavor in any way. And Text 2 never mentions fermentation at all.

Text 1

What factors influence the abundance of species in a given ecological community? Some theorists have argued that historical diversity is a major driver of how diverse an ecological community eventually becomes: differences in community diversity across otherwise similar habitats, in this view, are strongly affected by the number of species living in those habitats at earlier times.

Text 2

In 2010, a group of researchers including biologist Carla CÃ¡ceres created artificial pools in a New York forest. They stocked some pools with a diverse mix of zooplankton species and others with a single zooplankton species and allowed the pool communities to develop naturally thereafter. Over the course of four years, CÃ¡ceres and colleagues periodically measured the species diversity of the pools, finding-contrary to their expectations-that by the end of the study there was little to no difference in the pools' species diversity.

Based on the texts, how would CÃ¡ceres and colleagues (Text 2) most likely describe the view of the theorists presented in Text 1?

A. It is largely correct, but it requires a minor refinement in light of the research team's results.

B. It is not compelling as a theory regardless of any experimental data collected by the research team.

C. It may seem plausible, but it is not supported by the research team's findings.

D. It probably holds true only in conditions like those in the research team's study.

### ID: d72b325e Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. This is how CÃ¡ceres and co. would most likely describe the view presented in Text 1. The view in Text 1 is that historical diversity affects how diverse an ecological community eventually becomes. But CÃ¡ceres and co. did not qet this result: they found no difference in eventual diversity between a zooplankton pool that started out diverse and a zooplankton pool that started out with only a single species.

Choice A is incorrect. CÃ¡ceres and co. would probably not describe the view presented in Text 1 this way. The view in Text 1 is that historical diversity affects how diverse an ecological community eventually becomes. CÃ¡ceres and co's findings directly undermine this view: they found no difference in eventual diversity between a zooplankton pool that started out diverse and a zooplankton pool that started out with only a single species. Choice B is incorrect. CÃ¡ceres and co. would probably not describe the view presented in Text 1 this way. Their experiment was designed to test this hypothesis, and their findings were "contrary to their expectations" In other words, before the study, they predicted the theory was correct. Choice D is incorrect. Caceres and co. would not describe the view presented in

#### Text 1

Fossils of the hominin Australopithecus africanus have been found in the Sterkfontein Caves of South Africa, but assigning an age to the fossils is challenging because of the unreliability of dating methods in this context. The geology of Sterkfontein has caused soil layers from different periods to mix, impeding stratigraphic dating, and dates cannot be reliably imputed from those of nearby animal bones may have been relocated by flooding.

3.6

#### Text 2

Archaeologists used new cosmogenic nuclide dating techniques to reevaluate the ages of A. africanus fossils found in the Sterkfontein Caves. This technique involves analyzing the cosmogenic nucleotides in the matrix of rock fragments immediately surrounding the fossils. The researchers assert that this approach avoids the potential for misdating associated with assigning ages based on Sterkfontein's soil layers or animal bones.

Based on the texts, how would the researchers in Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined portion in Text 1?

- A. They would emphasize the fact that the A. africanus fossils found in the Sterkfontein Caves may have been corrupted in some way over the years.
- B. They would contend that if analyses of surrounding layers and bones in the Sterkfontein Caves were combined, then the dating of the fossils there would be more accurate.
- C. They would argue that their techniques are better suited than other methods to the unique challenges posed by the Sterkfontein Caves.
- D. They would claim that cosmogenic nuclide dating is reliable in the Sterkfontein Caves because it is applied to the fossils directly.

### ID: f3c45b4f Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. Text 2 states that the researchers used cosmogenic nuclide dating to "avoid the potential for misdating" caused by the geology of Sterkfontein, which Text 1 describes as "challenging" and unreliable.

Choice A is incorrect. Neither text suggests that the A. africanus fossils have been "corrupted," but only that traditional dating methods are difficult in Sterkfontein because of floods and soil mixing where the fossils were found. Nothing is implied to have compromised the fossils themselves. Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads Text 2. Text 2 agrees that stratigraphy and other methods are prone to error in the context of Sterkfontein: there's a "potential for misdating" when evaluating age based on soil layers and bones. Choice D is incorrect. Text 2 does not state that cosmogenic nuclide dating is applied to the fossils directly but rather to the breccia that surrounds them.

#### Text 1

Films and television shows commonly include a long list of credits naming the people involved in a production. Credit sequences may not be exciting, but they generally ensure that everyone's contributions are duly acknowledged. Because they are highly standardized, film and television credits are also valuable to anyone researching the careers of pioneering cast and crew members who have worked in the mediums.

#### Text 2

Video game scholars face a major challenge in the industry's failure to consistently credit the artists, designers, and other contributors involved in making video games. Without a reliable record of which people worked on which games, questions about the medium's development can be difficult to answer, and the accomplishments of all but its bestknown innovators can be difficult to trace.

Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the discussion in Text 2?

- A. By recommending that the scholars mentioned in Text 2 consider employing the methods regularly used by film and television researchers
- B. By pointing out that credits have a different intended purpose in film and television than in the medium addressed by the scholars mentioned in Text 2
- C. By suggesting that the scholars mentioned in Text 2 rely more heavily on credits as a source of information than film and television researchers do
- D. By observing that a widespread practice in film and television largely prevents the kind of problem faced by the scholars mentioned in Text 2

### ID: f7c02e89 Answer

#### Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 1 would most likely respond to Text 2 based on the information provided. Text 2 discusses how the inconsistent use of credits to identify the contributors to video games can pose an obstacle to scholars of the medium, who rely on such credits to answer questions about the medium's development. Text 1 notes that in film and television, on the other hand, credits are used consistently and are valuable to researchers studying the cast and crew members in these mediums. Since Text 1 asserts how the consistent use of credits benefits scholars of film and television, it can be inferred that this text's author would respond to the discussion in Text 2 by observing that the kind of problem faced by scholars of video qames-the inability to know who contributed to a particular production and how-is, in film and television studies, largely prevented by the widespread practice of credits in these mediums.

{11}------------------------------------------------

Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 1 discusses a method used by film and television researchers-namely, relying on credits to research the careers of cast and crew members-the author doesn't explicitly recommend that or any other method. Moreover, Text 1 states that films and television shows themselves, not their researchers, reqularly use the method of listing credits. Choice B is incorrect. It can be inferred from Text 2 that when video qames do feature credits, they have essentially the same function as credits in film and televisionâ€”namely, to identify the individuals who worked on a particular production. Therefore, it is unlikely that the author of Text I would characterize video game credits as differing in purpose from film and television credits. Choice C is incorrect because, as Text 2 explains, credits are not consistently used in video games. Therefore, it is unlikely that the author of Text 1 would argue that scholars of the medium discussed in this textâ€”video gamesâ€”rely more heavily on credits than scholars of film and television, two mediums where credits consistently appear.

Text 1

Like the work of Ralph Ellison before her, Toni Morrison's novels feature scenes in which characters deliver sermons of such length and verbal dexterity that for a time, the formal parameters of fiction for those of oral literature. Given the many other echoes of Ellison in Morrison's novels, both in structure and prose style, these scenes suggest Ellison's direct influence on Morrison.

Text 2

In their destabilizing effect on literary form, the sermons in Morrison's works recall those in Ellison's. Yet literature by Black Americans abounds in moments where interpolated speech erodes the division between oral and written forms that literature in English has traditionally observed. Morrison's attributable not only to the influence of Ellison but also to a community-wide strategy of resistance to externally imposed literary conventions.

Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely characterize the underlined claim in Text 1?

- A. As failing to consider Ellison's and Morrison's equivalent uses of the sermon within the wider in which they wrote
- B. As misunderstanding the function of sermons in novels by Black American writers other than Ellison and Morrison
- C. As disregarding points of structural and stylistic divergence between the works of Ellison and those of Morrison
- D. As being indebted to the tradition of resisting literary conventions that privilege written forms, such as novels, over sermons and other oral forms

### ID: e4e2aeb3 Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The author of Text 2 arques that Morrison's use of the sermon is not only influenced by Ellison, but also by a "community-wide strategy of resistance" to literary conventions practiced by Black American authors. Ellison, Text 2 alleges, is only one of many influences on Morrison.

Choice B is incorrect. Neither text specifically mentions sermons in works by authors other than Morrison or Ellison, only a tendency towards eroding "the division between oral and written forms" among Black American writers. Choice C is incorrect. Both texts describe similarities between the works of Ellison and Morrison, and neither points out instances of divergence. Text 2 simply suggests that Morrison was influenced by more than just Ellison. Choice D is incorrect. While Text 2 does discuss Morrison's resistance to certain literary conventions, it's unclear what it would mean for the underlined claim to be "indebted" to that tradition. This choice recycles lanquaqe from the text, but not in a way that makes any coherent point.

#### Text 1

Virginia Woolf's 1928 novel Orlando is an oddity within her body of work. Her other major novels consist mainly of scenes of everyday life and describe their characters' interior states in great detail, whereas Orlando propels itself through a series of fantastical events and considers its characters' psychology more superficially. Woolf herself sometimes regarded the novel as a minor work, even admitting once that she "began it as a joke."

#### Text 2

Like Woolf's other great novels, Orlando portrays how people's memories inform their experience of the present. Like those works, it examines how people navigate social interactions shaped by gender and social class. Though it is lighter in tone-more entertaining, even-this literary "joke" nonetheless engages seriously with the themet the four or five other novels by Woolf that have achieved the status of literary classics.

Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the assessment of Orlando presented in Text 1?

- A. By conceding that Woolf's talents were best suited to serious novels but asserting that the humor in Orlando is often effective
- B. By agreeing that Orlando is less impressive than certain other novels by Woolf but arguing that it should still be regarded as a classic
- C. By acknowledging that Orlando clearly differs from Woolf's other major novels but insisting on its centrality to her body of work nonetheless
- D. By concurring that the reputation of Orlando as a minor work has led readers to overlook this novel but maintaining that the reputation is unearned

### ID: 6a1dc7c5 Answer

#### Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the assessment of Orlando in Text 1. Both authors agree that Orlando is unusual for Woolf: Text 1 states that the novel examines its characters' psychologies more superficially than Woolf's other novels do, and Text 2 describes it as being lighter in tone. However, while Text 1 calls Orlando an "oddity" and mentions that Woolf "began it as a joke" Text 2 asserts that Orlando enqages the same themes as Woolf's other qreat novels. Hence, the author of Text 2 would most likely accept that Orlando differs from Woolf's other novels but would also insist on its importance in the context of Woolf's work as a writer.
{14}------------------------------------------------

Choice A is incorrect. Text 2 does suggest that the humor in Orlando is effective. However, there's nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the author would agree that Woolf's talents were best suited to serious novels. Rather, the author of Text 2 compares Orlando favorably to other novels by Woolf that are implied to be darker in tone. Choice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 does not indicate that Orlando is less impressive than Woolf's other novels, but instead points out that it engages the same themes as other novels by Woolf that are considered classics. Choice D is incorrect because there's nothing in Text 1 to suggest that readers have generally ignored Orlando because of its reputation.

#### Text 1

Despite its beautiful prose, The Guns of August, Barbara Tuchman's 1962 analysis of the start of World War I, has certain weaknesses as a work of history. It fails to address events in Eastern Europe just before the outbreak of hostilities, thereby giving the impression that Germany was the war's principal instigator. Had Tuchman consulted secondary works available to her by scholars such as Luigi Albertini, she would not have neglected the influence of events in Eastern Europe on Germany's actions.

#### Text 2

Barbara Tuchman's The Guns of August is an engrossing if dated introduction to World War I. Tuchman's analysis of primary documents is laudable, but her main thesis that European powers committed themselves to a catastrophic outcome by refusing to deviate from military plans developed prior to the conflict is implausibly reductive.

Which choice best describes a difference in how the authors of Text 2 view Barbara Tuchman's The Guns of August?

- A. The author of Text 1 argues that Tuchman should have relied more on the work of other historians, while the author of Text 2 implies that Tuchman's most interesting claims result from her original research.
- B. The author of Text 1 believes that the scope of Tuchman's research led her to an incorrect interpretation, while the author of Text 2 believes that Tuchman's central argument is overly simplistic.
- C. The author of Text 1 asserts that the writing style of The Guns of August makes it worthwhile to read despite any perceived deficiency in Tuchman's research, while the author of Text 2 focuses exclusively on the weakness of Tuchman's interpretation of events.
- D. The author of Text 1 claims that Tuchman would agree that World War I was largely due to events in Eastern Europe, while the author of Text 2 maintains that Tuchman would say that Eastern European leaders were not committed to military plans in the same way that other leaders were.

## ID: 17bf10de Answer

#### Correct Answer: B

## Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. Both texts are critical of The Guns of August, but for different reasons: the author of Text 1 argues that Tuchman missed an important factor leading up to the war because she didn't consult secondary sources, and the author of Text 2 argues that Tuchman's main thesis is "reductive"," which is a close synonym for "overly simplistic."

Choice A is incorrect. This doesn't accurately describe the difference. This choice's summary of Text 1 is accurate, but Text 2 never says that Tuchman's most interesting claims result from her original research. Choice C is

{16}------------------------------------------------

incorrect. This doesn't accurately describe the difference. Text 1 never says that The Guns of August is worthwhile to read despite its research weaknesses. Text 2 does call out a weakness of Tuchman's interpretation of events, but it also praises her analysis of primary sources. Choice D is incorrect. This doesn't accurately describe the difference. Text 1 actually says that Tuchman "fails to address" the influence of events in Eastern Europe, while Text 2 says that Tuchman's thesis was that European powers (not Eastern European leaders) were committed to military plans.

Text 1

The fossil record suggests that mammoths went extinct around 11 thousand years (kyr) ago. In a 2021 study of environmental DNA (eDNA)â€”genetic material shed into the environment by organismsâ€”in the Arctic, Yucheng Wang and colleagues found mammoth eDNA in sedimentary layers formed millennia later, around 4 kyr ago. To account for this discrepancy, Joshua H. Miller and Carl Simpson proposed that arctic temperatures could preserve a mammoth carcass on the surface, allowing it to leach DNA into the environment, for several thousand years. Text 2

3.11

Wang and colleagues concede that eDNA contains DNA from both living organisms and carcasses, but for DNA to leach from remains over several millennia requires that the remains be perpetually on the surfaces and weathering in the Arctic, however, are likely to break down surface remains well before a thousand years have passed.

Which choice best describes how Text 1 and Text 2 relate to each other?

- A. Text 1 discusses two approaches to studying mammoth extinction without advocating for either, whereas Text 2 advocates for one approach over the other.
- B. Text 1 presents findings by Wang and colleagues and gives another research team's attempt to explain those findings, whereas Text 2 provides additional detail that explanation into question.
- C. Text 1 describes Wang and colleagues' study and a critique of their methodology, whereas Text 2 offers additional details showing that methodology to be sound.
- D. Text 1 argues that new research has undermined the standard view of when mammoths went ext 2 suggests a way to reconcile the standard view with that new research.

## ID: de2c2f57 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. Text 1 introduces Wang and colleagues' study and its surprising results, and then mentions Miller and Simpson's hypothesis as a possible way to explain them. Text 2, however, challenges Miller and Simpson's hypothesis by pointing out the difficulties of preserving mammoth carcasses on the surface for thousands of years: "scavengers and weathering" are the additional details that complicate the Miller/Simpson hypothesis.

Choice A is incorrect. Neither text compares two different approaches for studying mammoth extinction. Text 1 describes one study and one hypothesis pertaining to it. Text 2 critiques that hypothesis. Choice C is incorrect. Text l does not describe a critique of Wang and colleagues' methodology, but rather an interpretation of their results by Miller and Simpson. Text 2 does not offer additional details showing that methodology to be sound, but rather casts doubt on the Miller/Simpson explanation. Choice D is incorrect. Both components mentioned here (the new

{18}------------------------------------------------

"undermining" research and the theory for reconciling this discovery) are contained in Text 1. Text 2 then shows how the attempt to reconcile the standard view and new research is flawed, and still fails to explain the discrepancy.

#### Text 1

Dominique Potvin and colleagues captured five Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen) to test a new design for attaching tracking devices to birds. As the researchers fitted each magpie with a tracker attached by a small harness, they noticed some magpies without trackers pecking at another magpie's tracker until it broke off. The researchers suggest that this behavior could be evidence of magpies attempting to help another magpie without benefiting themselves.

#### Text 2

It can be tempting to think that animals are deliberately providing help when we see them removing trackers and other equipment from one another, especies is known to exhibit other cooperative behaviors. At the same time, it can be difficult to exclude the possibility that individuals are simply interested in the equipment because of its novelty, curiously pawing or pecking at it until it detaches.

Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the researchers' perspective in Text 1 on the behavior of the magpies without trackers?

- A. That behavior might have been due to the novelty of the magpies' captive setting rather than to the novelty of the tracker.
- B. That behavior likely indicates that the magpies were deliberately attempting to benefit themselves by obtaining the tracker.
- C. That behavior may not be evidence of selflessness in Gymnorhina tibicen because not all the captured magpies demonstrated it.
- D. That behavior might be adequately explained without suggesting that the magpies were attempting to assist the other magpie.

## ID: 35e21b06 Answer

#### Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the researchers' perspective in Text 1 on the behavior of the magpies without trackers. According to Text 1, Dominique Potvin and colleagues observed magpies without trackers pecking at a tracker on another magpie until the device fell off. The researchers suggested that the birds might have been attempting to help the other bird, with no benefit to themselves. Text 2 qenerally discusses scenarios in which animals have been observed removing trackers from each other. The text cautions that it shouldn't be assumed that these animals are helping one another deliberately, since they might simply be pecking at trackers out of curiosity, causing them to fall off eventually. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Potvin and colleagues' perspective in Text 1 by saying that the

{20}------------------------------------------------

behavior of the magpies without trackers could be adequately explained without suggesting that they were attempting to assist the other magpie.

Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 never discusses the novelty, or the newness and unusual quality, of the captive settings in which animals have been observed to remove trackers from other animals, nor does it suggest that such novelty might account for this behavior. Instead, the text suqqests that it's the novelty of the tracking equipment itself that might cause the behavior: interested in the trackers because they're unusual, animals might paw or peck at them until they fall off. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 never suggests that when animals remove trackers from other animals, they do so because they wish to obtain the trackers for themselves. Instead, Text 2 argues that animals paw or peck at trackers because they are merely curious about them. Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn't argue that when captured animals are observed removing trackers from each other, their behavior should be regarded as selfless only if all of them participate in it. Instead, the text argues that the behavior may not be selfless at all and may instead be attributed to animals' curiosity about the new and unusual trackers.
