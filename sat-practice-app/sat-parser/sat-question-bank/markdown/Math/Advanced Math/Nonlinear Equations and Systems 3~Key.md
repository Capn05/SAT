3.1

In the æy-plane, a line with equation 2y = 4.5 intersects a parabola at exactly one point. If the parabola has equation y = - 4x2 + bx, where b is a positive constant, what is the value of b?

### ID: fc3d783a Answer

Correct Answer: 6

Rationale

The correct answer is 6. It's given that a line with equation 2y = 4.5 intersects a parabola with equation y = - 4x2 + bx, where b is a positive constant, at exactly one point in the xy-plane. It follows that the system of equations consisting of 2y = 4.5 and y = -4x - + bx has exactly one solution. Dividing both sides of the equation of the line by 2 yields y = 2. 25. Substituting 2.25 for y in the equation of the parabola yields 2. 25 = - 4x2 + bx. Adding 4x2 and subtracting bx from both sides of this equation yields 4x2 - bx + 2. 25 = 0. A quadratic equation in the form of ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants, has exactly one solution when the discriminant, b2 — 4ac, is equal to zero. Substituting 4 for a and 2.25 for c in the expression 62 — 4ac and setting this expression equal to 0 yields 62 — 4 (4) (2. 25) = 0, or 62 — 36 = 0. Adding 36 to each side of this equation yields b2 = 36. Taking the square root of each side of this equation yields b = ±6. It's given that b is positive, so the value of b is 6.

3.2

Which ordered pair is a solution to the system of equations above?

- A. (1 + / 3, J3) B. (3, - V3) c. (1+15, J5)
- D. (15, -1+5)

### ID: 4661e2a9 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. The solution to the given system of equations can be found by solving the first equation for x, which gives x = y + 1, and substituting that value of x into the second equation which gives y +1 + y = (y + 1)2 - 3. Rewriting this equation by adding like terms and expanding (y + 1)2 gives 2y + 1 = y2 + 2y - 2. Subtracting 2y from both sides of this equation gives 1 = y - 2. Adding to 2 to both sides of this equation gives 3 = y2. Therefore, it follows that y = ±√3. Substituting √ 3 for y in the first equation yields x = √ 3 = 1. Adding √ 3 to both sides of this equation yields x = 1 + √ 3. Therefore, the ordered pair (1 +√ 3,√ 3) is a solution to the given system of equations.

Choice B is incorrect. Substituting √ 3 for x and −√ 3 for y in the first equation yields √ 3 −(−√ 3) = 1, or 2√3 = 1, which isn't a true statement. Choice C is incorrect. Substituting 1 +√ 5 for x and √ 5 for y in the second equation yields (1 +√5) +√5 = (1 +√5)² −3, or 1 +2√5 =2√5 +3, which isn't a true statement. Choice D is incorrect. Substituting √ 5 for x and (-1 +√ 5) for y in the second equation yields √5 +(-1 +√5) = (√5)2 = 3, or 2√5 - 1 = 2, which isn't a true statement.

| B. - 1 |  |
| C. 1   |  |
| D. 3   |  |

### ID: 7bd10ef3 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. The number of solutions to any quadratic equation in the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants, can be found by evaluating the expression b - 4ac, which is called the discriminant. If the value of b - 4 a positive number, then there will be exactly two real solutions to the equation. If the value of be – 4ac is zero, then there will be exactly one real solution to the equation. Finally, if the value of b2 – 4 ac is negative, then there will be no real solutions to the equation.

The given equation 2x2 – 4x = t is a quadratic equation in one variable, where t is a constant. Subtracting t from both sides of the equation gives 2x2 – 4x – t = 0. In this form, a = 2, b = − 4, and c = − t. The values of t for which the equation has no real solutions are the same values of t for which the discriminant of this equation is a negative value. The discriminant is equal to (-4)2-4(2)(-1); therefore, (-4)2-4(2)(-1) < 0 Simplifying the left side of the inequality gives 16+8t < 0. Subtracting 16 from both sides of the inequality and then dividing both sides by 8 gives t < – 2. Of the values given in the options, — 3 is the only value that is less than =2. Therefore, choice A must be the correct answer.

Choices B, C, and D are incorrect and may result from a misconception about how to use the discriminant to determine the number of solutions of a quadratic equation in one variable.

√2x+6+4=x+3

What is the solution set of the equation above?

A. {-1}

B. (5)

C. {-1, 5}

D. {0, - 1, 5}

#### ID: 66bce0c1 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. Subtracting 4 from both sides of √ 2x + 6 + 4 = x + 3 isolates the radical expression on the left side of the equation as follows: √ 2x + 6 = x − 1. Squaring both sides of √ 2x + 6 = x − 1 yields 2x +6 = x2 = 2x + 1. This equation can be rewritten as a quadratic equation in standard form: x - 4x −5 = 0 One way to solve this quadratic equation is to factor the expression X--4x -5 by identifying two numbers with a sum of –4 and a product of –5. These numbers are —5 and 1. So the quadratic equation can be factored as (x −5)(x + 1) = 0. It follows that 5 and − 1 are the solutions to the quadratic equation. However, the solutions must be verified by checking whether 5 andー1 satisfy the original equation, √ 2x + 6 + 4 = x + 3 When x = = 1, the original equation gives √ 2(-1) + 6 + 4 = (-1) + 3, or 6 = 2, which is false. Therefore, = 1 does not satisfy the original equation. When x = 5, the original equation gives √ 2(5) + 6 = 5 + 3, or 8 = 8, which is true. Therefore, x = 5 is the only solution to the original equation, and so the solution set is {5}.

Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because each of these sets contains at least one value that results in a false statement when substituted into the given equation. For instance, in choice D, when 0 is substituted for x into the given equation, the result is √ 2(0) + 6 + 4 = (0) + 3, or √ 6 + 4 = 3. This is not a true statement, so 0 is not a solution to the given equation.

-(x-4)2+10 The graph of the function f, defined by f(x) = -, is shown in the xy-plane above. If the function g (not shown) is defined by

g(x)= - x + 10, what is one possible value of a such that f(a) = g(a) ?

#### ID: 97e50fa2 Answer

Rationale

The correct answer is either 2 or 8. Substituting y = a in the definitions for f and g gives

(a-4)2 + 10 and g(a) = - a+10, respectively. If f(a) = g(a), then = = (a-4)2 + 10 = - a+10 f(a) = Subtracting 10 from both sides of this equation gives – 2 (a – 4)2 = – a . Multiplying both sides by —2 gives (a-4)2 = 2a. Expanding (a-4) gives a2-8a+16=2a. Combining the like terms on one side of the equation gives a - 10a + 16 = 0. One way to solve this equation is to factor a - 10a + 16 by identifying two numbers with a sum of — 10 and a product of 16. These numbers are —2 and —8, so the quadratic equation can be factored as (a -2)(a -8) = 0. Therefore, the possible values of a are either 2 or 8. Note that 2 and 8 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer.

Alternate approach: Graphically, the condition f (d) = g(d) implies the graphs of the functions y = f(x) and y =g(x) intersect at x = a The graph y = f(x) is given, and the graph of y =g(x) may be sketched as a line with y-intercept 10 and a slope of —1 (taking care to note the different scales on each axis). These two graphs intersect at x = 2 and x = 8

### -16x2 - 8x + c = 0

In the given equation, c is a constant. The equation has exactly one solution. What is the value of c?

#### ID: 3d12b1e0 Answer

Correct Answer: -1

Rationale

The correct answer is – 1. A quadratic equation in the form ax – + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants, has exactly one solution when its discriminant, 62 — 4ac, is equal to 0. In the given equation, -16x2 - 8x + c = 0, a = - 16 and b = - 8. Substituting -16 for a and -8 for b in b2 - 4ac yields (-8)2 - 4(-16)(c), or 64 + 64c. Since the given equation has exactly one solution, 64 + 64c = 0. Subtracting 64 from both sides of this equation yields 64c = =64. Dividing both sides of this equation by 64 yields c = - 1. Therefore, the value of c is -1.

A. - 3

B. -2

C. - 1

D. 1

#### ID: e9349667 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. The system of equations can be solved using the substitution method. Solving the second equation for y gives y = = = = 1. Substituting the expression =x = 1 for y into the first equation gives −x − 1 = x + 2x + 1. Adding x + 1 to both sides of the equation yields x + 3x + 2 = 0. The left-hand side of the equation can be factored by finding two numbers whose sum is 3 and whose product is 2, which gives (x + 2)(x + 1) = 0. Setting each factor equal to 0 yields x + 2 = 0 and solving for x yields x = −2 or x = −1. These values of x can be substituted for x in the equation y = −x − 1 to find the corresponding y = −(−2) − 1 = 2 − 1 = 1 and y = -(-1) = 1 = 1 = 0. It follows that (-2, 1) and (-1, 0) are the solutions to the given system of equations. Therefore, (x], y]) = (-2, 1), (x2, y2) = (-1, 0), and y1 + y2 = 1 + 0 = 1.

Choice A is incorrect. The solutions to the system of equations are (x1, y1) = (-2, 1) and (x7, yo) = (-1, 0). Therefore, -3 is the sum of the x-coordinates of the solutions, not the y-coordinates of the solutions. Choices B and C are incorrect and may be the result of computation or substitution errors.

Choice A is correct. It's given that the graph of y = x - 9 and line p intersect at (1,a) and (5,b). Therefore, the value of y when x = 1 is the value of a, and the value of y when x = 5 is the value of b. Substituting 1 for x in the given equation yields y = (1)2 - 9, or y = - 8. Similarly, substituting 5 for x in the given equation yields y = (5) - 9, or y = 16. Therefore, the intersection points are (1, - 8) and (5,16). The slope of line p is the ratio _ 24 16 – (– 8) of the change in y to the change in x between these two points: 5-1 4 , or 6.

Choices B, C, and D are incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors in determining the values of a, b, or the slope of line p.

In the xy-plane, the graph of J = 3x2 - 14x intersects the graph of y = x at the points (0, 0) and (a, a). What is the value of a ?

### ID: 1697ffcf Answer

#### Rationale

The correct answer is 5. The intersection points of the graphs of y =3x2 – 14x and y = x can be found by solving the system consisting of these two equations. To solve the system, substitute x for y in the first equation. This gives x = 3x2-14x. Subtracting x from both sides of the equation gives 0 = 3x-15x. Factoring 3x out of each term on the left-hand side of the equation gives 0 = 3x(x = 5). Therefore, the possible values for x are 0 and 5. Since y = x, the two intersection points are (0,0) and (5,5). Therefore, a = 5.

x2 — 40x — 10 = 0

What is the sum of the solutions to the given equation?

A. 0 B. 5 c. 10

D. 40

## ID: ff2e5c76 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. Adding 10 to each side of the given equation yields x2 — 40x = 10. To complete the square, adding ( 4) , or 202, to each side of this equation yields x2 - 40x + 202 = 10 + 202, or (x - 20)2 = 410. Taking the square root of each side of this equation yields x - 20 = ±√410. Adding 20 to each side of this equation yields x = 20 ± √ 410. Therefore, the solutions to the given equation are x = 20 + √ 410 and x = 20 - √ 410. The sum of these solutions is (20 + √ 410) + (20 v410 , or 40.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

How many solutions are there to the system of equations above?

- A. There are exactly 4 solutions.
- B. There are exactly 2 solutions.
- C. There is exactly 1 solution.
- D. There are no solutions.

## ID: 2c5c22d0 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is correct. The second equation of the system can be rewritten as y = 5x −8. Substituting 5x −8 for y in the first equation gives 5x -8 = x2 +3x -7. This equation can be solved as shown below:

$$\chi^2 + 3\chi - 7 - 5\chi + 8 = 0$$

- x2-2x+1=0
- (x-1)2=0

## x = 1

Substituting 1 for x in the equation y = 5x =8 gives y = - 3. Therefore, (1, - 3) is the only solution to the system of equations.

Choice A is incorrect. In the xy-plane, a parabola and a line can intersect at no more than two points. Since the graph of the first equation is a parabola and the graph of the second equation is a line, the system cannot have more than 2 solutions. Choice B is incorrect. There is a single ordered pair (X,Y) that satisfies both equations of

the system. Choice D is incorrect because the ordered pair (1, -3) satisfies both equations of the system.

## ID: fc3dfa26 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is correct. Each fraction in the given equation can be expressed with the e common denominator
 2x2-6x2-6x2-6x2-6x2-6x2-2x2-2 2x 1 x +3 x2-9 Multiplying x+3 by x -3 yields x2-9 ,and multiplying x-3 by x+3 yields y2 4x2 _ 2x2-6x _ x+3 Therefore, the given equation can be written as x2 – 9 the denominator results in the equation 4x2 -(2x2-6x) = x + 3, or 2x2 + 6x = x + 3. This equation can be solved by setting a quadratic expression equal to 0, then solving for x. Subtracting x + 3 from both sides of this equation yields 2x2 +5x -3 = 0. The expression 2x2 +5x -3 can be factored, resulting in the equation (2x - 1)(x +3) = 0. By the zero product property, 2x - 1 = 0 or x + 3 = 0. To solve for x in 2x - 1 = 0, 1 can be added to both sides of the equation, resulting in 2x = 1. Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 results in z . Solving for x in x +3 = 0 yields x = −3. However, this value of x would result in the second fraction of

{23}------------------------------------------------

Choice A is incorrect and may result from solving x +3 = 0 but not realizing that this solution is extraneous because it would result in a denominator of 0 in the second fraction. Choice B is incorrect and may result from a sign error when solving 2x – 1 = 0 for x. Choice D is incorrect and may result from a calculation error.

The solution to the given system of equations is (x, y). What is the value of x?

## ID: 58b109d4 Answer

Correct Answer: -10

Rationale

The correct answer is - 10. Adding y to both sides of the second equation in the given system yields 20x + 100 = y. Substituting 20x + 100 for y in the first equation in the given system yields x + 20x + 100 + 7 = 7. Subtracting 7 from both sides of this equation yields x2 + 20x + 100 = 0. Factoring the left-hand side of this equation yields (x + 10) = 0, or (x + 10) = 0, or (x + 10) = 0. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields x + 10 = 0. Subtracting 10 from both sides of this equation yields x = - 10. Therefore, the value of x is -10.

5(x + 7) = 15(x = 17)(x + 7) What is the sum of the solutions to the given equation?

### ID: 7028c74f Answer

Correct Answer: 10.33, 31/3

### Rationale

The correct answer is 2 . Subtracting 5x + 7 from each side of the given equation yields 0 = 15x - 7 - 5x + 7. Since 5x + 7 is a common factor of each of the terms on the right-hand side of this equation, it can be rewritten as 0 = 5x + 73x - 17 - 1. This is equivalent to 0 = 5x + 73x - 51 - 1, or 0 = 5x + 73x - 52. Dividing both sides of this equation by 5 yields 0 = x + 73x - 52. Since a product of two factors is equal to 0 if and only if at least one of the factors is 0, either x + 7 = 0 or 3x - 52 = 0. Subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation x + 7 = 0 yields x = -7. Adding 52 to both sides of the equation 3x - 52 = 0 yields 3x = 52. Dividing both sides of this equation by 3 yields x = 3. Therefore, the solutions to the given equation are -7 and 3. It follows that the sum of the given equation is -7 + 3, which is equivalent to Note that 31/3 and 10.33 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer.

## ID: e11294f9 Answer

Correct Answer: 31

#### Rationale

The correct answer is 31. Subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation x2 + 6x + 7 = 0 yields x2 + 6x = - 7. To complete the square, adding ද් , or 34, to both sides of this equation yields x2 + 6x + 3² = 2. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields x + 3 = ± √2 . Subtracting 3 from both sides of this equation yields x = - 3 ± √2 . Therefore, the solutions r and s to the equation x 2 + 6x + 7 = 0 are -3 - √ 2 and -3 + - (2 . Since r < s, it follows that r = - 3 - , 2 and s = - 3 + , 2 . Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation x2 + 8x + 8 = - 8 . To complete the square, adding දී, or 42, to both sides of this equation yields x2 + 8x + 42 = - 8 + 4 , or x + 42 = 8. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields x + 4 = ± ~ 8 , or x + 4 = ± 2 , 2 . Subtracting 4 from both sides of this equation yields x = - 4 ± 2% Σ. Therefore, the solutions t and u to the equation x2 + 8x + 8 = 0 are -4 - 2 (2 and -4 + 2 , 2 Since t < u, it follows that t = - 4 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 14 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 0 , where c is a constant, are + + t and s + u. It follows that this equation can be written as x - r + tx - s + u = 0, which is equivalent to se - r + t + s + ux + r + ts + u = 0. Therefore, the value of c is r + ts + u. Substituting - 3 - 1 2 for t, - 3 + , 2 for t, - 3 + , 2 for s, and -4 +2 /2 for u in this equation yields -3 - (2 + -4 - 2 /2 + -4 + 2 /2 , which is equivalent to -7 - 3 /2 -7 + 3 , 2 -7 + 3 , 2 -7 + 3 , 2 -7 + 3 , 2 -7 + 3 , or -7-7 - 3-12 3-72 , which is equivalent to 49 - 18, or 31. Therefore, the value of c is 31.
