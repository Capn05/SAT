ID: 371cbf6b (ax +3)(5x2-bx +4) = 20x3 -9x2-2x +12

3.1

The equation above is true for all x, where a and b are constants. What is the value of ab ?

A. 18 B. 20

C. 24

D. 40

### ID: 371cbf6b Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is correct. If the equation is true for all x, then the expressions on both sides of the equation will be equivalent. Multiplying the polynomials on the left-hand side of the equation gives 5ax3 - abx2 + 4ax + 15x2 - 3bx + 12 on the right-hand side of the equation, the only x -term is -9x . Since the expressions on both sides of the equation are equivalent, it follows that — dbx2 + 15x2 = — 9x2, which can be rewritten as (-ab +15)x2 = −9x2. Therefore, −ab +15 = −9, which gives ab =24.

Choice A is incorrect. If ab = 18, then the coefficient of X on the left-hand side of the equation would be – 18 + 15 = – 3, which doesn't equal the coefficient of X , – 9, on the right-hand side. Choice B is incorrect. If ab = 20, then the coefficient of X on the left-hand side of the equation would be —20 + 15 = — 5, which doesn't equal the coefficient of X, -9, on the right-hand side. Choice D is incorrect. If ab = 40, then the coefficient of X on the left-hand side of the equation would be —40 + 15 = — 25, which doesn't equal the coefficient of X2, –9, on the right-hand side.

#### ID: 34847f8a Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is correct. To express the sum of the two rational expressions on the left-hand side of the equation as the single rational expression on the right-hand side of the equation, the expressions on the left-hand side 2(x +5) x +5 must have the same denominator. Multiplying the first expression by x -5 results in (x -2)(x +5), and 3(x-2) x - 2 multiplying the second expression by x -2 results in (x-2)(x+5), so the given equation can be rewritten 2(x +5) rx + t 2x + 10 3x-6 rx + t + (x -2)(x +5) (x-2)(x+5), or (x-2)(x+5) as (x-2)(x+5) (x-2)(x+5) (x-2)(x+5) . Since the two rational expressions on the left-hand side of the equation have the same denominator as the rational expression on the right-hand side of the equation, it follows that (2x +10) +(3x -6) = rx + t. Combining like terms on the left-hand side yields 5x +4 = rx + t, so it follows that r = 5 and t = 4. Therefore, the value of rt is (5)(4) = 20.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from an error when determining the sign of either r or t. Choice B is incorrect and may result from not distributing the 2 and 3 to their respective terms in

2(x +5) 3(x-2) IX + I (x-2)(x+5) (x -2)(x +5) . Choice D is incorrect and may result from a calculation error.

Correct Answer: .0177, .0178, 4/225

Rationale

The correct answer is An expression of the form Va, where k is an integer greater than 1 and a ≥ 0, is equivalent to a #. Therefore, the given expression, where n > 1, is equivalent to (70n) \$ (70m.) . Applying properties of exponents, this expression can be rewritten as (70%) 2 (70%) 2 (70%) 3 (70%) 3 (70%) 3 , which can be rewritten as (70%) = + 3, or (70%) = . It's given that the expression √ 70% ( √70% is equivalent to (70n)30x where n > 1. It follows that (70%) is equivalent to (70%) 30%. Therefore, 유 = 30x. Dividing both sides of this equation by 30 yields to enter a correct answer.

The expression (3x - 23)(19x + 6) is equivalent to the expression ax + bx + c, where a, b, and care constants. What is the value of b?

#### ID: ea6d05bb Answer

Correct Answer: -419

Rationale

The correct answer is -419. It's given that the expression (3x - 23)(19x + 6) is equivalent to the expression ax + + c, where a, b, and care constants. Applying the distributive property to the given expression, (3x - 23)(19x + 6), yields (3x)(19x) + (3x)(6) - (23)(6), which can be rewritten as 57x2 + 18x - 437x - 138. Combining like terms yields 57x2 - 419x - 138. Since this expression is equivalent to ax2 + bx + c, it follows that the value of b is -419.

ID: d8789a4c Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

x2-c
=====x+b Choice A is correct. If the given expression is equivalent to x + b, then x = b Multiplying both sides of this equation by x – b yields x – c = (x +b)(x – b). Since the right-hand side of this equation is in factored form for the difference of squares, the value of c must be a perfect square. Only choice A gives a perfect square for the value of c.

Choices B, C, and D are incorrect. None of these values of c produces a difference of squares. For example, x2-6

when 6 is substituted for c in the given expression, the result is X — b . The expression x — 0 can't be

### x2-6

factored with integer values, and therefore x - b isn't equivalent to x + b.

0.36x2 + 0.63x + 1.17

The given expression can be rewritten as a(42° + 7x + 13), where a is a constant. What is the value of a?

#### ID: 5355c0ef Answer

Correct Answer: .09, 9/100

Rationale

The correct answer is .09. It's given that the expression 0.36x2 + 0.63x + 1.17 can be rewritten as a (4x2 + 7x + 13). Applying the distributive property to the expression a (4x2 + 7x + 13) yields 4ax2 + 7ax + 13a. Therefore, 0.36x2 + 0.63x + 1.17 can be rewritten as 4ax2 + 7ax + 13a. It follows that in the expressions 0.36x2 + 0.63x + 1.17 and 4xx2 + 7ax + 13a, the coefficients of x2 are equivalent, the coefficients of x are equivalent, and the constant terms are equivalent. Therefore, 0.36 = 7a, and 1.17 = 13a. Solving any of these equations for a yields the value of a. Dividing both sides of the equation 0.36 = 4a by 4 yields 0.09 = a. Therefore, the value of a is 0.09. Note that .09 and 9/100 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer.

In the expression 3(2x2 +px +8) - 16x(p +4) , p is a constant. This expression is equivalent to the expression 6x2 — 155x +24. What is the value of p ?

A. - 3

B. 7

C. 13

D. 155

#### ID: c81b6c57 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. Using the distributive property, the first given expression can be rewritten as 6x + 3px + 24 – 16px – 64x + 24, and then rewritten as 6x + (3p – 16p – 64)x + 24. Since the expression 6x + (3p - 16p -" - 155x + 24, the coefficients of the x terms from each expression are equivalent 64)x + 24 is equivalent to 6x to each other; thus 3p – 16p – 64 = –155. Combining like terms gives –13p – 64 = –155. Adding 64 to both sides of the equation gives –13p = –71. Dividing both sides of the equation by –13 yields p = 7.

Choice A is incorrect. If p = −3, then the first expression would be equivalent to 6x - 25x + 24. Choice C is incorrect. If p = 13, then the first expression would be equivalent to 6x 155, then the first expression would be equivalent to 6x - 2,079x + 24.

f (x) Choice D is correct. Since x3-9x =x(x +3)(x =3) and x2-2x =3 = (x + 1)(x = 3), the fraction g(x) can be x(x+3)(x-3) written as (x+1)(x –3) . It is given that x > 3, so the common factor x — 3 is not equal to 0. Therefore, the x(x +3) fraction can be further simplified to X + 1 f (x) 1 1

Choice A is incorrect. The expression x+1 is not equivalent to g(x) because at x =0, x+1 as a value of 1 f (x) and g(x) has a value of 0.

Choice B is incorrect and results from omitting the factor x in the factorization of ƒ(x). Choice C is incorrect and may result from incorrectly factoring g(x) as (x +1)(x +3) instead of (x +1)(x -3)

#### ID: 12e7faf8 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is correct. Since the expression x2+6x – 7 can be factored as (x+7)(x – 1), the given equation can (x+7)(x=1) = ax + d x +7 . Since x ≠ −7, x +7 is also not equal to 0, so both the numerator and be rewritten as (x +7)(x - 1)

 can be divided by x +7. This gives x − 1 = αχ + d. Equating the coefficient of x denominator of x +7 on each side of the equation gives n = 1. Equating the constant terms gives d = = 1. The sum is 1 +(-1) = 0.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from incorrectly simplifying the equation. Choices B and D are incorrect. They are the values of d and a, respectively, not a + d.

$$\frac{2}{\infty} \times +1 - \frac{2}{\infty - 3}$$

#### ID: 89fc23af Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. The numerator of the given expression can be rewritten in terms of the denominator, x — 3 , as follows: x2-2x-5=x2-3x+x-3-2, which is equivalent to x(x-3)+(x-3)-2. So the given 2 x x expression is equivalent to x −3 . Since the given expression is -3 x - 3 x - 3 2 defined for x ≠ 3, the expression can be rewritten as × + 1 x -3

Long division can also be used as an alternate approach. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect and may result from errors made when dividing the two polynomials or making use of structure.

3.15

The expression above can be written in the form ay 2 + b , where a and b are constants. What is the value of a + b ?

#### ID: 911c415b Answer

Rationale

The correct answer is 6632. Applying the distributive property to the expression yields (7532 + 100y2) + (100y2 - 1100). Then adding together 7532 + 100y2 and 100y2 - 1100 and collecting like terms results in 200y2+6432. This is written in the form ay2+b, where a =200 and b =6432. Therefore a+b=200+6432=6632
