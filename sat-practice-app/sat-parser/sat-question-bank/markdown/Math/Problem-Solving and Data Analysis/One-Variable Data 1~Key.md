What is the median of the seven data values shown?

A. 2 B. 3 C. 4

D. 9

## ID: f890dc20 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. When a data set has an odd number of values, the median can be found by ordering the values from least to greatest and determining the value in the middle. Since the values are already presented in order from least to greatest and there are 7 values, the fourth value in the list. Therefore, the median is 3.

Choice A is incorrect. This is the mode. Choice C is incorrect. This is the mean. Choice D is incorrect. This is the range.

Data set A: 72, 13, 73, 73, 76, 76 Data set B: 61, 64, 74, 85, x

Data set A and data set B each contain 5 numbers. If the mean of data set A is equal to the mean of data set B, what is the value of x ?

A. 77

B. 85

C. 86

- D. 95
#### ID: 8736334b Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is correct. The mean of a data set is found by dividing the sum of the values in the data set by the 72+73+73+76+76 number of values in the data set. Therefore, the mean of data set A is 5 , which simplifies 61 +64 +74 +85 + x 284 + x to 74. The mean of data set B is represented by the equation . It's qiven that 5 , or 5 284 + x the mean of data set A is equal to the mean of data set B. Therefore, the equation 1 can be used to 5 solve for x. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 5 yields 370 = 284 +x. Subtracting 284 from both sides of this equation yields 86 = x.

Choices A, B, and D are incorrect and may result from calculation errors.

Which of the following statements correctly compares the means of data set A and data set B?

A. The mean of each data set is 2.

B. The mean of each data set is 4.

C. The mean of data set A is less than the mean of data set B.

D. The mean of data set A is greater than the mean of data set B.

#### ID: 708590d7 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. The mean of a data set is found by dividing the sum of the values in the data set by the 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 number of values in the data set. Therefore, the mean of data set A is f , or 4. The 1+1+2+2+3+3+4 16 mean of data set B is 7 , or approximately 2.2857. Therefore, the mean of data set

A is greater than the mean of data set B.

Alternate approach: Data set B are both ordered from least to greatest value. Besides the first value in each data set, which is 1, each value in ordered data set B is less than the respective value in ordered data set A. Therefore, conceptually, the mean of data set A must be greater than the mean of data set B.

Choices A, B, and C are incorrect and may result from various misconceptions or miscalculations.

|-----------------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| High temperature (ยฐF) | 81 | 80 | 81 | 81 | 82 |

Over this 5-day period, which of the following is NOT equal to 81ยฐF?

A. Median of the high temperatures

B. Mean of the high temperatures

C. Mode of the high temperatures

D. Range of the high temperatures

ID: 869a32f1 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. The range of a data set is the difference between the maximum values in the set. The maximum value among the high temperatures in the table is 82ยฐF and the minimum value is 80ยฐF. Therefore, the range is 82ยฐF - 80ยฐF = 2ยฐF.

Choice A is incorrect. The median of a data set is the middle values in the set are ordered from least to greatest. Ordering the high temperatures this way gives the list 80, 81, 81, 82. Therefore, the median high temperature is 81ยฐF. Choice B is incorrect. The mean high temperature is

81 +80 +81 +81 +82 405 =81 . Choice C is incorrect. The mode is the value that occurs the greatest 5 5 number of times. For the set of high temperatures shown, 81 is the value that occurs 3 times, and therefore,

81ยฐF is the mode of the high temperatures.

- 1. The mean number from Foothill High School is greater than the mean number from Valley High School.
- 2. The median number from Foothill High School is greater than the median number from Valley High School.

A. I only

- B. Il only
- C. I and II
- D. Neither I nor II

### ID: 6670e407 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is correct. The mean of a data set is found by dividing the sum of the number of values. Therefore, the mean number of students who completed summer internships from Foothill High School is 87 +80 +75 +76 +70 388

5

5 , or 77.6. Similarly, the mean number from Valley High School is

{17}------------------------------------------------

44 +54 +65 + 76 + 82 321 , or 64.2. Thus, the mean number from Foothill High School is greater than the 5

mean number from Valley High School. When a data set has an odd number of elements, the median can be found by ordering the values from least to greatest and determining the value in the middle. Since there are five values in each data set, the third value in each ordered list is the median. Therefore, the median number from Foothill High School is 76 and the median number from Valley High School is 65. Thus, the median number from Foothill High School is greater than the median number from Valley High School.

Choices A, B, and D are incorrect and may result from various misconceptions or miscalculations.

Type of monkey

How many more vervets are in this sanctuary than mandrills?

- A. 11
- B. 6
- C. 5
- D. 3

ID: 57481175 Answer

Correct Answer: B

{19}------------------------------------------------

#### Rationale

Choice B is correct. It's given that the bar graph shows the number of each type of monkey in a sanctuary. The bar representing the number of mandrills has a height of 5; therefore, there are 5 mandrills in the sanctuary. The bar representing vervets has a height of 11; therefore, there are 11 vervets in the sanctuary. There are 11 - 5, or 6, more vervets in this sanctuary than mandrills.

Choice A is incorrect. This is the number of vervets in the sanctuary.

Choice C is incorrect. This is the number of mandrills in the sanctuary.

Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.
