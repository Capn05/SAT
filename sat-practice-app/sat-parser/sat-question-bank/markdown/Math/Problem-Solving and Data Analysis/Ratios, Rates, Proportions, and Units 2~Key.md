A. 285.6

B. 571.2

C. 856.8

D. 17,136.0

### ID: d28c29e1 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. Since 1 minute = 60 seconds and 1 hour = 60 minutes, it follows that 1 hour = (60)(60), or 3,600 seconds. Using this conversion factor, the space station's average speed of 4.76 miles per second is equal 17, 136 miles 4.76 miles 3,600 seconds _ to an average speed of , or 17,136 miles per hour. second hour hour

Choice A is incorrect. This is the space station's average speed in miles per minute. Choice B is incorrect. This is double the space station's average speed in miles per minute, or the number of miles the space station travels on average in 2 minutes. Choice C is incorrect. This is triple the space station's average speed in miles per minute, or the number of miles the space station travels on average in 3 minutes.

The population density of Iceland, in people per square kilometer of land area, increased from 2.5 in 1990 to 3.3 in 2014. During this time period, the land area of Iceland was 100,250 square kilometers. By how many people did Iceland's population increase from 1990 to 2014?

A. 330,825

B. 132,330

- C. 125,312
- D. 80,200

### ID: b4912cc5 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. The increase in Iceland's population can be found by multiplying the increase in population density, in people per square kilometer, by the area, in square kilometers. It's qiven that the population density of Iceland was 2.5 people per square kilometer in 1990 and 3.3 people per square kilometer in 2014. The increase in population density can be found by subtracting 2.5 from 3.3, which yields 0.8. It's qiven that the land area of Iceland was 100,250 square kilometers. Thus, the increase in population is 0.8(100,250), or 80,200.

Alternate approach: It's given that the population density of Iceland, in people per square kilometer of land area, in 1990 was 2.5. Since the land area of Iceland was 100,250 square kilometers, it follows that the population of Iceland in 1990 was 2.5(100,250), or 250,625. Similarly, the population of Iceland in 2014 was 3.3(100,250), or 330,825. The population increase is the difference in the population from 1990 to 2014, or 330,825 – 250,625, which yields 80,200. Therefore, Iceland's population increased by 80,200 from 1990 to 2014.

Choice A is incorrect. This is the population of Iceland in 2014. Choice B is incorrect and may result from dividing 3.3 by 2.5, instead of subtracting 2.5 from 3.3. Choice C is incorrect and may result from dividing the population of Iceland in 1990 by 2.

On April 18, 1775, Paul Revere set off on his midnight ride from Charlestown to Lexington. If he had ridden straight to Lexington without stopping, he would have traveled 11 miles in 26 minutes. In such a ride, what would the average speed of his horse have been, to the nearest tenth of a mile per hour?

### ID: fea831fc Answer

#### Rationale

The correct answer is 25.4. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance 11 is 11 miles and the total time is 26 minutes. Thus, the average speed is 26 miles per minute. The question asks for the average speed in miles per hour, and there are 60 minutes in an hour; converting miles per minute to miles per hour gives the following:

11 miles 60 minutes Average speed = 26 minutes 1 hour 660 miles per hour 26

### ~25.38 miles per hour

Therefore, to the nearest tenth of a mile per hour, the average speed of Paul Revere's ride would have been 25.4 miles per hour. Note that 25.4 and 127/5 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer.

$$\text{A. } \frac{4}{3}w$$

$$\text{B. } w + 5$$

$$3$$

$$\text{c. } \frac{3}{4}w$$

D. w - 5

### ID: 181cc4d6 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. It's given that rectangle A has length 15 and width w. Therefore, the length-to-width ratio of rectangle A is 15 to w. It's also given that rectangle B has length 20 and the same length-to-width ratio as 15 20 rectangle A. Let x represent the width of rectangle B. The proportion w can be used to solve for x in x 15x =20 terms of w. Multiplying both sides of this equation by x yields , and then multiplying both sides of w 20w this equation by w yields 15x = 20w. Dividing both sides of this equation by 15 yields * 三 15 . Simplifying this fraction yields X =

Choices B and D are incorrect and may result from interpreting the difference in the lengths of rectangle A and rectangle B as equivalent to the difference in the widths of rectangle B. Choice C is incorrect and may result from using a length-to-width ratio of w to 15, instead of 15 to w.

Tanya earns \$13.50 per hour at her part-time job. When she works z hours, she earns 13.50z dollars. Which of the following expressions gives the

amount, in dollars, Tanya will earn if she works 3z hours?

A. 3(13.50z)

B. 3 + 13.50z

- C. 3z + 13.50z
- D. 13.50(z+3)

### ID: 445dd032 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. It's given that when Tanya works z hours, she earns 13.50Z dollars. Since her hourly rate is constant, if she works 3 times as many hours, or 3z hours, she will earn 3 times as many dollars, or 3(13.50z).

Choice B is incorrect. This expression represents adding 3 dollars to the 13.50z dollars Tanya will earn. Choice C is incorrect. This expression can be rewritten as 16.50z, which implies that Tanya earns \$16.50 per hour, not \$13.50. Choice D is incorrect. This expression adds 3 to the number of hours Tanya works, rather than multiplying the hours she works by 3.

One of a planet's moons orbits the planet every 252 days. A second moon orbits the planet every 287 days. How many more days does it take the second moon to orbit the planet 29 times than it takes the first moon to orbit the planet 29 times?

### ID: e21d10a7 Answer

Correct Answer: 1015

Rationale

The correct answer is 1,015. It's given that the first moon orbits the planet every 252 days. Therefore, it takes the first moon 252(29), or 7,308, days to orbit the planet 29 times. It's also given that the second moon orbits the planet every 287 days. Therefore, it takes the second moon 287 (29), or 8,323, days to orbit the planet 29 times. Since it takes the first moon 7,308 days and the second moon 8,323 days, it takes the second moon 8,323 - 7,308, or 1,015, more days than it takes the first moon to orbit the planet 29 times.

Which of the following speeds is equivalent to 90 kilometers per hour? (1 kilometer = 1,000 meters)

- A. 25 meters per second
- B. 32 meters per second
- C. 250 meters per second
- D. 324 meters per second

#### ID: 8917ce38 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. Since 1 kilometer is equal to 1,000 meters, it follows that 90 kilometers is equal to 90(1,000) = 90,000 meters. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes and 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds, it follows

90 kilometers 90,000 meters that 1 hour is equal to 60(60) = 3,600 seconds. Now is equal to 3,600 seconds , which 1 hour 25 meters

reduces to 1 second or 25 meters per second.

Choices B, C, and D are incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

The total area of a coastal city is 92.1 square miles, of which 11.3 square miles is water. If the city had a population of 621,000 people in the year 2010, which of the following is closest to the population density, in people per square mile of land area, of the city at that time?

A. 6,740

B. 7,690

- C. 55,000
- D. 76,000

### ID: 1180401d Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. The land area of the coastal city can be found by subtracting the area of the water from the total area of the coastal city; that is, 92.1 – 11.3 = 80.8 square miles. The population density is the population

621,000 = 7,686 divided by the land area, or , which is closest to 7,690 people per square mile. 80.8

Choice A is incorrect and may be the result of dividing the population by the total area, instead of the land area. Choice C is incorrect and may be the result of dividing the population by the area of water. Choice D is incorrect and may be the result of making a computational error with the decimal place.

### d = 55t

The equation above can be used to calculate the distance d, in miles, traveled by a car moving at a speed of 55 miles per hour over a period of t hours. For any positive constant k, the distance the car would have traveled after 9k hours is how many times the distance the car would have traveled

after 3k hours?

A. 3

B. 6

- C. 3k
D. 6k

### ID: f6cbb04a Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. Since the distance is equal to the amount of time multiplied by a constant, the given equation d = 55f represents a proportional relationship between distance and time in this situation. Since

9k = 3 · 3 · 3 · the time when is 3 times the time when t = 3 k hours. Therefore, the distance traveled after 9k hours is 3 times the distance after 3k hours.

Choices B and D are incorrect and may result from interpreting the proportional relationship between time and distance as additive rather than multiplicative. Choice C is incorrect and may result from an arithmetic error.
