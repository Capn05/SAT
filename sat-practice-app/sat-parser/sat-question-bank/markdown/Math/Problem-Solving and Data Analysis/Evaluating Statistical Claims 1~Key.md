The members of a city council wanted to assess the opinions of all city residents about converting an open field into a dog park. The council surveyed a sample of 500 city residents who own dogs. The survey showed that the majority of those sampled were in favor of the dog park. Which of the following is true about the city council's survey?

A. It shows that the majority of city residents are in favor of the dog park.

B. The survey sample should have included more residents who are dog owners.

C. The survey sample should have consisted entirely of residents who do not own dogs.

D. The survey sample is biased because it is not representative of all city residents.

### ID: 9bf4c545 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. The members of the city council wanted to assess opinions of all city residents. To gather an unbiased sample, the council should have used a random sampling design to select subjects from all city residents. The given survey introduced a sampling bias because the 500 city residents surveyed were all dog owners. This sample is not representative of all city residents because not all city residents are dog owners.

Choice A is incorrect because when the sampling method isn't random, there is no quarantee that the survey results will be reliable; hence, they cannot be generalized to the entire population. Choice B is incorrect because a larger sample of residents who are dog owners would not correct the sampling bias. Choice C is incorrect because a survey sample of entirely non-dog owners would likely have a biased opinion, just as a sample of doq owners would likely have a biased opinion.

A market researcher selected 200 people at random from a group of people who indicated that they liked a certain book. The 200 people were shown a movie based on the book and then asked whether they liked or disliked the movie. Of those surveyed, 95% said they disliked the movie. Which of the following inferences can appropriately be drawn from this survey result?

A. At least 95% of people who go see movies will dislike this movie.

B. At least 95% of people who read books will dislike this movie.

C. Most people who dislike this book will like this movie.

D. Most people who like this book will dislike this movie.

#### ID: 82dfb646 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. The sample was selected from a group of people who indicated that the book. It is inappropriate to generalize the result of the survey beyond the population from which the participants were selected. Choice D is the most appropriate inference from the survey results because it describes a conclusion about people who liked the book, and the results of the survey indicate that most people who like the book disliked the movie.

Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because none of these inferences can be drawn from the survey results. Choices A and B need not be true. The people surveyed all liked the book on which the movie was based, which is not necessarily true of all people who go see movies or all people who read books. Thus, the people surveyed are not representative of all people who qo see movies or all people who read books. Therefore, the results of this survey cannot appropriately be extended to at least 95% of people who go see movies or to at least 95% of people who read books. Choice C need not be true because the sample includes only people who liked the book, and so the results do not extend to people who dislike the book.
