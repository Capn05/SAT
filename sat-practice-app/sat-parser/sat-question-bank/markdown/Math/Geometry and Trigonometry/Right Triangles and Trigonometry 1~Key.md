Correct Answer: C

{1}------------------------------------------------

## Rationale

Choice C is correct. The Pythagorean theorem states that for a right triangle, a2 + 6 = 2, where a and b represent the lengths of the legs of the triangle and crepresents the length of its hypotenuse. In the triangle shown, the legs have lengths of 3 and 7. Substituting 3 for a and 7 for b in the equation a 2 + 0 = c , which is equivalent to 9 + 49 = 0; or 58 = cÂ². Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields 7.6. Therefore, of the given choices, 7.6 is the closest to the length of the triangle's hypotenuse.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.
