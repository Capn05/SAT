The researchers found that pea plants, after being repeatedly exposed to a puff of air immediately followed by an unpleasant dark environment, began to anticipate the unpleasant stimulus. The team claims that this anticipatory behavior indicates that pea plants can learn to associate a neutral stimulus (air puff) with a negative one (darkness), a form of learning previously attributed primarily to animals.

In a review of 1,500 such models predicting stock market crashes, analysts found that while 85% of the models successfully predicted crashes, only about 15% of those did so for reasons aligned with widely accepted economic principles, such as shifts in investor confidence or changes in interest rates.  Instead, the analysts concluded that the crash predictions in the majority of models were primarily driven by inherent mathematical patterns within the model's algorithms, rather than genuine reflections of economic dynamics.  But even this successful prediction of market crashes has less to do with the models accurately reflecting real-world economic forces than it does with the mathematical structure built into the models.

This view was largely based on studies focusing primarily on the direct effects of wolf predation on elk populations. However, recent research employing advanced ecological modeling suggests a more nuanced understanding. These models indicate that wolves exert a cascading trophic effect, significantly altering vegetation patterns and river morphology through their influence on elk behavior and distribution.

While the exact mechanisms are still under investigation, scientists have proposed several hypotheses regarding the relative importance of these cues. One prominent hypothesis suggests that bees primarily rely on polarized light patterns in the sky for long-distance navigation, especially on sunny days. This hypothesis is supported by experiments showing bees can orient themselves accurately even when landmarks are removed, as long as they can see the sky.",
