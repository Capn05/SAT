They point to studies showing that access to parks and gardens reduces stress levels and promotes physical activity.  Furthermore, these green spaces can foster a sense of community by providing areas for social interaction and local events.  #### Text 2  While the benefits of urban green spaces are often touted, it's important to consider the practicalities and potential drawbacks.  Economist Dr. Lena Weiss argues that converting valuable urban land into parks can lead to increased housing costs and reduced economic productivity.  She contends that focusing on efficient urban planning and affordable housing is a more direct approach to improving residents' overall quality of life.  Based on the texts, how would Weiss (Text 2) most likely respond to the arguments made in Text 1?",

Once limited to scheduled broadcasts, viewers now have on-demand access to vast libraries of content. This shift has empowered audiences to watch what they want, when they want, leading to significant changes in viewing habits and the television industry itself.  #### Text 2  While streaming offers undeniable convenience, some argue it has drawbacks. The binge-watching culture it fosters can lead to a less social viewing experience, as people increasingly watch alone or in smaller groups, rather than gathering for communal viewing events. Furthermore, the constant availability of content may diminish the anticipation and shared cultural moments once associated with watching television.

The notion that bacteria could thrive in the highly acidic environment of the stomach, let alone cause ulcers, was considered unlikely by many. While some researchers proposed a bacterial link, their findings were often met with skepticism, and traditional treatments focused on managing stomach acid and lifestyle changes.  #### Text 2  Since the groundbreaking work of Barry Marshall and Robin Warren in the early 1980s, the medical consensus has shifted significantly. It is now widely accepted that *Helicobacter pylori* (*H. pylori*) bacteria play a crucial role in the development of peptic ulcers. Extensive research has established a strong correlation between *H. pylori* infection and ulcer formation. Consequently, antibiotics have become a standard component in ulcer treatment, alongside acid-reducing medications, reflecting the current understanding of *H. pylori* as a key factor in ulcer pathogenesis.  Based on the texts, both Text 1 and Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement regarding the understanding of peptic ulcers?",

    "question_text": "**Text 1**  Studies have consistently shown a correlation between increased screen time and decreased attention spans in adolescents.  Researchers hypothesize that the constant barrage of rapidly changing stimuli on digital devices overloads developing neural pathways, hindering the ability to sustain focused attention on a single task.  This suggests a direct causal link: the more time young people spend engaging with screens, the less capable they become of deep, sustained concentration.  **Text 2**  While concerns about screen time and attention spans are prevalent, recent research indicates a more nuanced relationship.  A study using EEG measurements found that while prolonged screen exposure *can* lead to attentional shifts, these shifts are primarily towards *selective* attention—the ability to filter out distractions and focus on relevant information within a complex environment. This suggests that screen time may not diminish overall attention, but rather reshape attentional skills in adaptive ways for the digital age.  Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the assertion in Text 1 that increased screen time directly causes a decrease in the capacity for sustained concentration?",

She posits that a guaranteed income floor would reduce financial precarity, allowing individuals to pursue education, entrepreneurship, or more fulfilling careers.  Sharma contends that this increased economic agency would lead to a more skilled and motivated workforce, ultimately driving innovation and overall economic output.  #### Text 2  Sociologist Ben Carter, while acknowledging the potential benefits of UBI, expresses concern about its impact on workforce participation.  Carter's research suggests that a UBI, without robust complementary programs and social support systems, could lead to a decrease in overall labor force participation. He argues that for some individuals, a guaranteed income might disincentivize work, particularly in lower-paying jobs, potentially offsetting any gains in productivity from increased education and entrepreneurship.  Based on the texts, how would Ben Carter (Text 2) most likely respond to Anya Sharma's (Text 1) argument about the productivity benefits of UBI?  - A. By conceding that UBI might improve individual well-being but questioning whether these improvements would translate into measurable gains in national productivity - B. By challenging the assumption that financial security is the primary factor limiting individual pursuit of education and entrepreneurship - C. By cautioning that the potential reduction in workforce participation due to UBI could counteract any positive effects on national productivity - D.

Participants were divided into two groups: one group used blue-light emitting devices (smartphones, tablets) for two hours before bed, and the other group used devices with blue-light filters for the same duration.  The study found that the blue-light exposure group reported significantly lower sleep quality and increased sleep latency (time to fall asleep) compared to the blue-light filter group.  #### Text 2  A separate study in 2021 explored the effects of ambient temperature on sleep. Participants slept in rooms with varying temperatures (18°C, 22°C, 26°C).  The results indicated that participants in the 18°C room experienced more frequent awakenings and reduced REM sleep duration compared to those in the 22°C and 26°C rooms.

Oral traditions, in particular, rely on the art of narrative to embody and preserve a community's identity, beliefs, and collective memory. The nuances of tone, rhythm, and even the physical presence of the storyteller enrich the transmission of these narratives, creating a deeply engaging and memorable experience for listeners.  #### Text 2  While digital archives offer unprecedented capacity for storing and disseminating information, some scholars express concern about their effectiveness in preserving cultural heritage.  The conversion of complex cultural expressions, such as nuanced oral histories and traditional performances, into digital formats may inevitably lead to a loss of vital contextual elements.  These elements, often intangible and experiential, are crucial for fully understanding and appreciating the cultural significance of the original forms.

Proponents argue that these measures effectively deter consumption by increasing prices or raising awareness of health risks.  They point to studies showing a correlation between increased taxes on sugary drinks and a decrease in their sales, concluding that such policies are crucial for combating obesity and related diseases.  Text 2  While taxation and labeling may play a role, the focus on individual sugary drinks overlooks the broader issue of added sugars in processed foods.  These hidden sugars, found in everything from bread to sauces, contribute significantly to overall sugar intake and are less easily targeted by drink-specific interventions.  Effective public health strategies must address the pervasive nature of added sugars across the entire food supply, not just isolated beverage categories.

They envision a future where AI enhances human creativity, allowing for new forms of artistic expression.  #### Text 2  While AI offers intriguing possibilities for creative fields, it is essential to approach its integration with caution.
