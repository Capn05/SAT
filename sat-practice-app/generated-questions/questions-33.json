While Alfred Wegener proposed continental drift in the early 1900s based on fossil and geological evidence, his lack of a convincing mechanism for how continents moved led to widespread skepticism.  However, new discoveries in the mid-20th century, particularly concerning seafloor spreading and paleomagnetism, provided the missing mechanism and compelling evidence.

However, with the advent of vaccines, a safer and more controlled pathway to herd immunity became possible.  While natural infection can confer immunity, it often comes at the cost of widespread illness and death. Vaccines, on the other hand, can stimulate the immune system to develop protection without causing the disease itself, thus offering a way to achieve herd immunity with significantly less suffering.
