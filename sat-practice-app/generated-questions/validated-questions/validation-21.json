To solve this, we first calculate the total number of fruits sold at each market: Green Valley (60 + 45 + 30 = 135) and Sunny Orchard (40 + 55 + 70 = 165). The total number of fruits sold at both markets is 135 + 165 = 300. The fraction of fruits sold at Sunny Orchard is therefore $\frac{165}{300}$. Simplifying this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (which is 15), we get $\frac{165 \\\\div 15}{300 \\\\div 15} = \frac{11}{20}$. Option A, $\frac{11}{20}$, is indeed the correct answer. The other options are incorrect as they do not simplify to $\frac{165}{300}$.

From the table, we know that 180 adults prefer to read ebooks.  Let 'x' be the number of adults who prefer to read physical books. The total number of adults is the sum of adults who prefer ebooks and adults who prefer physical books. So, 380 = 180 + x. Solving for x, we get x = 380 - 180 = 200.

Simplifying this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 20, we get: $\\\\frac{160 \\\\div 20}{420 \\\\div 20} = \\\\frac{8}{21}$.  The calculated correct answer is $\\\\frac{8}{21}$. However, option A is given as $\\\\frac{16}{41}$.  $\\\\frac{16}{41} \\\\approx 0.3902$ and $\\\\frac{8}{21} \\\\approx 0.3810$. While these values are close, they are not the same, and $\\\\frac{8}{21}$ is the exact answer based on the provided data. Therefore, the option marked as correct (A) is not actually correct.  The question itself is clear and makes sense, and the difficulty level is appropriate. The other options are clearly incorrect compared to the calculated correct answer of $\\\\frac{8}{21}$, but option A is also not precisely correct."

Therefore, we cannot determine which genre's hardcover population is closest to being 1/4 of the total.  While option C (Biography) is marked as correct, we cannot verify this without the table data.  Furthermore, even with a hypothetical table, it's possible that multiple options could be equally close, or that another option is actually closer, depending on the specific numbers in the table.

      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and easy to understand. To solve it, first determine the number of green marbles.  Since there are 60 total marbles and 24 are yellow, the number of green marbles is 60 - 24 = 36. The probability of selecting a green marble is the ratio of the number of green marbles to the total number of marbles, which is 36/60. This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 12.  36 ÷ 12 = 3 and 60 ÷ 12 = 5. Therefore, the simplified probability is 3/5. Option A, 3/5, is the correct answer. Option B, 2/5, is incorrect. Option C, 2/3, is incorrect. Option D, 3/2, is incorrect because a probability cannot be greater than 1.

      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and asks for a conditional probability. We are given that the student chosen is a junior.  From the table, there are 15 juniors in the Debate Club and 10 juniors in the Math Club. The total number of juniors participating in either Debate Club or Math Club (or both, although it's implied they are in different activities based on the table structure) is 15 + 10 = 25.  The probability that a randomly chosen junior participates in the Debate club is the number of juniors in the Debate Club divided by the total number of juniors in extracurricular activities listed. This is $\frac{15}{25}$. Simplifying this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 5, we get $\frac{15 \\\\div 5}{25 \\\\div 5} = \frac{3}{5}$. Option C, $\frac{3}{5}$, is the simplified form of the correct probability and is marked as correct. Option A, $\frac{15}{25}$, is numerically equivalent to the correct answer but is not in simplified form. In SAT questions, simplified fractions are generally preferred. However, option A is also mathematically a correct representation of the probability. Options B and D are incorrect. Option B, $\frac{15}{55}$, uses a denominator that is not relevant to the conditional probability given that the student is a junior. Option D, $\frac{15}{75}$, also uses an incorrect denominator. The difficulty level 'Medium' is appropriate for this question as it requires understanding of conditional probability and reading data from a table, skills typically tested at a medium difficulty level on the SAT. While option A is also numerically correct, option C is the simplified and thus the expected answer in the context of SAT. Therefore, considering option C as the single 'correct' answer and A, B, D as incorrect options is reasonable in the SAT context."

The probability that a 12th-grade student prefers History is given as $\frac{1}{6}$.  The number of 12th-grade students who prefer History is Y. The total number of 12th-grade students is the sum of students who prefer Math, English, Science, and History in the 12th grade, which is $30 + 45 + 35 + Y = 110 + Y$.  The probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes (students who prefer History) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (all 12th-grade students). So, we have the equation: $\frac{Y}{110 + Y} = \frac{1}{6}$.  To solve for Y, we can cross-multiply: $6Y = 1 \times (110 + Y)$. This simplifies to $6Y = 110 + Y$. Subtracting Y from both sides gives $5Y = 110$. Dividing by 5 gives $Y = \frac{110}{5} = 22$. Therefore, the value of Y is 22, and option B is indeed the correct answer. The other options are incorrect because substituting them back into the probability equation does not yield $\frac{1}{6}$. The difficulty level 'Hard' is appropriate as it requires setting up an equation and solving for a variable within a probability context, which is typical of SAT level problem-solving questions."

To find the number of Fiction books, we multiply the total number of books by the probability of selecting a Fiction book: 55,000 * 0.68 = 37,400. Since $f$ represents the number of Fiction books in thousands, we have $f = 37,400 / 1,000 = 37.4$. Rounding $37.4$ to the nearest integer gives $37$. Therefore, the value of $f$ to the nearest integer is 37, which corresponds to option B.Let's check the other options:- Option A (35): This would mean 35,000 Fiction books. The probability would be 35,000 / 55,000 = 35/55 ≈ 0.636, which is further from 0.68 than the probability for option B.- Option C (39): This would mean 39,000 Fiction books. The probability would be 39,000 / 55,000 = 39/55 ≈ 0.709, which is further from 0.68 than the probability for option B.- Option D (40): This would mean 40,000 Fiction books. The probability would be 40,000 / 55,000 = 40/55 ≈ 0.727, which is further from 0.68 than the probability for option B.Option B (37) gives the closest probability to 0.68.

Therefore, the conditional probability is the ratio of the number of Grade 10 students in Math Club to the total number of students in Math Club, which is 12/25.  Converting this fraction to a decimal, we get 12/25 = 0.48. Option A (0.48) is the correct answer. Options B, C, and D are incorrect.
