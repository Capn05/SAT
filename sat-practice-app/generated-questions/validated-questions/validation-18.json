For a system of linear equations to have no solution, the lines must be parallel but not coincident.  This occurs when the ratio of the coefficients of x is equal to the ratio of the coefficients of y, but not equal to the ratio of the constants.For the given system:$$ 3x + 4y = 12 $$$$ 6x + by = 5 $$The ratio of the coefficients of x is $\frac{6}{3} = 2$.The ratio of the coefficients of y is $\frac{b}{4}$.For the lines to be parallel, these ratios must be equal:$$ \frac{b}{4} = 2 $$Solving for b:$$ b = 2 \times 4 = 8 $$Now we need to check if for $b=8$, the lines are not coincident.  If $b=8$, the system becomes:$$ 3x + 4y = 12 $$$$ 6x + 8y = 5 $$Multiply the first equation by 2:$$ 6x + 8y = 24 $$$$ 6x + 8y = 5 $$Since $24 \neq 5$, the lines are parallel and distinct, meaning there is no solution.Let's check the other options:A. If $b=2$, the system is $3x + 4y = 12$ and $6x + 2y = 5$. The ratio of x coefficients is $6/3 = 2$, and the ratio of y coefficients is $2/4 = 1/2$. Since the ratios are not equal, the lines are not parallel and there is a solution.B. If $b=4$, the system is $3x + 4y = 12$ and $6x + 4y = 5$. The ratio of x coefficients is $6/3 = 2$, and the ratio of y coefficients is $4/4 = 1$. Since the ratios are not equal, the lines are not parallel and there is a solution.D. If $b=12$, the system is $3x + 4y = 12$ and $6x + 12y = 5$. The ratio of x coefficients is $6/3 = 2$, and the ratio of y coefficients is $12/4 = 3$. Since the ratios are not equal, the lines are not parallel and there is a solution.Therefore, only $b=8$ results in a system with no solution. Option C is indeed the correct answer, and options A, B, and D are incorrect. The question is clearly written, grammatically correct, and the difficulty level is appropriate for a 'Hard' SAT question as it requires understanding the conditions for systems of linear equations to have no solution.

      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and asks for the equation that, when paired with 3x - 9y = 6, results in a system with no solution.  A system of linear equations has no solution when the lines are parallel and distinct.  First, simplify the given equation 3x - 9y = 6 by dividing by 3 to get x - 3y = 2. For a system to have no solution, the second equation must be parallel to x - 3y = 2 but not identical. Parallel lines have the same slope, which means they have proportional coefficients for x and y.Option A: x - 3y = 2 is identical to the simplified first equation. This system would have infinitely many solutions, not no solution.Option B: x - 3y = 10 has the same coefficients for x and y as the simplified first equation (1 and -3 respectively), but a different constant term (10 vs 2). This indicates parallel lines that are distinct, resulting in no solution. Thus, Option B is correct.Option C: 3x + 9y = 6 simplifies to x + 3y = 2. The coefficient of y is +3, while in the first equation it is -3. These lines are not parallel and will intersect at a single point, resulting in one solution.Option D: 3x + y = 6. The coefficient of y is +1, while in the first equation it is -3. These lines are not parallel and will intersect at a single point, resulting in one solution.Therefore, Option B is the only option that results in a system with no solution, and the other options lead to systems with either infinitely many solutions (Option A if considered in simplified form) or a unique solution (Options C and D). The difficulty level 'Hard' is appropriate as it requires understanding the conditions for no solution in linear systems and manipulating equations."

      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and asks for the value of $10x$ given the system of equations $2y = 7x + 12$ and $2y = 2x + 2$. To solve for $x$, we can set the two expressions for $2y$ equal to each other: $7x + 12 = 2x + 2$. Subtracting $2x$ from both sides gives $5x + 12 = 2$. Subtracting $12$ from both sides gives $5x = -10$. Dividing by $5$ gives $x = -2$. Therefore, $10x = 10 \times (-2) = -20$. Option A, -20, is indeed the correct answer.  To verify that other options are incorrect, we can test each option. If $10x = -10$, then $x = -1$. Substituting $x = -1$ into the equations gives $2y = 7(-1) + 12 = 5$ and $2y = 2(-1) + 2 = 0$, which leads to different values for $2y$, so $x = -1$ is not a solution. Similarly, for $10x = 10$ ($x = 1$), $2y = 7(1) + 12 = 19$ and $2y = 2(1) + 2 = 4$. For $10x = 20$ ($x = 2$), $2y = 7(2) + 12 = 26$ and $2y = 2(2) + 2 = 6$. In all cases other than $x = -2$, the values of $2y$ are inconsistent, confirming that options B, C, and D are incorrect. The question is grammatically correct and appropriately formatted. The difficulty level of 'Hard' is reasonable for an SAT question involving systems of linear equations, particularly as it requires a few steps to solve and asks for $10x$ rather than just $x$, potentially adding a slight layer of complexity."
