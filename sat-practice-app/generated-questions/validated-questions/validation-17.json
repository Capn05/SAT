Let x be the total number of fruits in the first basket and y be the total number of fruits in the second basket.  In the first basket, 20% of fruits are apples, so there are 0.2x apples. In the second basket, 60% of fruits are apples, so there are 0.6y apples. The total number of apples is the sum of apples from both baskets, which is 0.2x + 0.6y. The problem states that together, the baskets must contain at least 300 apples, which translates to the inequality 0.2x + 0.6y ≥ 300. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they either reverse the percentages for the baskets (Option B), or use the wrong inequality sign (Options C and D) to represent 'at least 300 apples'.

Small coffees cost $2 each and are represented by 'x', so the revenue from small coffees is 2x. Large coffees cost $4 each and are represented by 'y', so the revenue from large coffees is 4y. The total revenue is the sum of these two, which is 2x + 4y.  The question states that the total revenue must be 'at least $60', which translates to 'greater than or equal to 60'.

To find the maximum number of large boxes, we need to consider the constraints given: the truck must carry at least 12 boxes in total, and the total weight cannot exceed 600 pounds. Let 'l' be the number of large boxes and 's' be the number of small boxes. We have the following inequalities:\n\n1.  s + l ≥ 12 (minimum number of boxes)\n2.  30s + 50l ≤ 600 (maximum weight)\n\nWe want to maximize 'l'. Let's test the options starting from the largest:\n\nOption D: 13 large boxes.\nIf l = 13, the weight from large boxes alone is 13 * 50 = 650 pounds, which exceeds the 600-pound limit. So, 13 large boxes is not possible.\n\nOption C: 12 large boxes.\nIf l = 12, the weight from large boxes is 12 * 50 = 600 pounds. To meet the minimum number of boxes constraint (s + l ≥ 12), we can have s = 0. In this case, s + l = 0 + 12 = 12 ≥ 12, and the total weight is 30*0 + 50*12 = 600 ≤ 600. Both conditions are satisfied. So, 12 large boxes is possible.\n\nOption B: 11 large boxes.\nIf l = 11, the weight from large boxes is 11 * 50 = 550 pounds. To meet the minimum number of boxes constraint (s + l ≥ 12), we need at least s = 1. If s = 1, then s + l = 1 + 11 = 12 ≥ 12, and the total weight is 30*1 + 50*11 = 30 + 550 = 580 ≤ 600. Both conditions are satisfied. However, we are looking for the *maximum* number of large boxes, and we already found that 12 is possible.\n\nOption A: 10 large boxes.\nIf l = 10, the weight from large boxes is 10 * 50 = 500 pounds. To meet the minimum number of boxes constraint (s + l ≥ 12), we need at least s = 2. If s = 2, then s + l = 2 + 10 = 12 ≥ 12, and the total weight is 30*2 + 50*10 = 60 + 500 = 560 ≤ 600. Both conditions are satisfied. Again, we are looking for the maximum.\n\nComparing the valid options, 12 is the largest number of large boxes that satisfies both conditions. Therefore, option C is indeed the correct answer, and options A, B, and D are incorrect as they are either not the maximum or violate the constraints. The difficulty level of 'Medium' is appropriate as it requires setting up and solving inequalities or testing values within constraints, which is typical for SAT math questions.

      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and makes sense. It asks for an inequality representing the possible total revenue from coffee sales, given that the coffee shop sells between 350 and 400 cups of coffee and each cup costs $3. To find the minimum revenue, we multiply the minimum number of cups (350) by the price per cup ($3), which is 350 * 3. To find the maximum revenue, we multiply the maximum number of cups (400) by the price per cup ($3), which is 400 * 3. Therefore, the possible total revenue (x) is represented by the inequality (350)(3) < x < (400)(3). Option B correctly represents this inequality. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they do not correctly apply the price per cup to calculate the revenue range. Option A adds the price instead of multiplying. Option C and D incorrectly place the addition or multiplication of the price within the range of the number of cups sold instead of applying it to calculate the revenue range. The difficulty level is appropriately marked as Medium, as it requires a basic understanding of revenue calculation and inequalities."

To solve this problem, we first need to express the total cost in terms of the base daily rate ($d$) and the number of miles driven ($m$). The total cost is given by: Total Cost = $d + 0.10m$.  The problem states that the total cost should be at least 1.5 times and at most 2 times the base daily rate. This can be written as a compound inequality: 1.5d ≤ Total Cost ≤ 2d. Substituting the expression for the total cost, we get: 1.5d ≤ d + 0.10m ≤ 2d.  To find the possible values of $m$, we solve this compound inequality.  First, consider the left inequality: 1.5d ≤ d + 0.10m. Subtracting $d$ from both sides gives: 0.5d ≤ 0.10m. Dividing both sides by 0.10 (or multiplying by 10) gives: 5d ≤ m.  Next, consider the right inequality: d + 0.10m ≤ 2d. Subtracting $d$ from both sides gives: 0.10m ≤ d. Dividing both sides by 0.10 (or multiplying by 10) gives: m ≤ 10d.  Combining both inequalities, we get 5d ≤ m ≤ 10d. This matches option A, which is marked as correct. Options B, C, and D are incorrect as they do not represent the derived range for $m$. Option B has incorrect bounds, Option C represents the range for the total cost in terms of 'd' and not 'm', and Option D has bounds that are too high.

Therefore, the total number of representatives who achieved their target must be greater than 60.This can be written as the inequality: 45 + q > 60Now let's examine the options:Option A: q + 45 > 0.30(200), where q ≤ 100. This simplifies to q + 45 > 60, which is the correct inequality. The condition q ≤ 100 is also correct because q represents the number of representatives out of 100 in the second group who achieved the target, so q cannot be greater than 100.Option B: q > 0.30(200 + 45), where q ≤ 100. This option incorrectly calculates 30% of (200 + 45) instead of 30% of 200.Option C: q - 45 > 0.30(200), where q < 100. This option uses subtraction instead of addition of the number of representatives who achieved the target in both groups, and the inequality is incorrect. Also, q < 100 is not necessarily implied by the problem statement, although q ≤ 100 is true by definition.Option D: q + 45 > 0.30(100), where q ≤ 100. This option incorrectly calculates 30% of only one group (100) instead of 30% of all representatives (200).Therefore, option A is the only correct option.
