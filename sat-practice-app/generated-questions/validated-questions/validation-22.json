In the sample of 25 loaves, 3 were underbaked. This gives a proportion of underbaked loaves in the sample as 3/25. To estimate the total number of underbaked loaves out of the 400 produced, we apply this proportion to the total production: (3/25) * 400 = 48. Option C, 48, is indeed the correct answer. The other options are clearly incorrect as they do not represent a reasonable estimation based on the sample proportion. Option A (3) is simply the number of underbaked loaves in the sample, not an estimate for the total production. Options B (12) and D (75) do not follow logically from a simple proportional estimation. The difficulty level 'Easy' is appropriate as this is a straightforward application of sample proportions, a concept typically considered easy within SAT math problem-solving."

The margin of error suggests that we are reasonably confident that the true percentage lies within the interval [26%, 34%]. Therefore, it is unlikely (and in the context of SAT questions, often interpreted as 'not possible' within the given confidence level) that the true percentage is less than 26%. While statistically, 'not possible' is too strong a statement, in the simplified context of SAT margin of error questions, it is often used to indicate values outside the plausible range defined by the margin of error.Option C is incorrect because while 34% is within the plausible range, the margin of error indicates a range of values, not that the true percentage is exactly at the upper bound.Option D is incorrect because 35% is outside the range of 30% ± 4%. Therefore, it is *not* doubtful, but rather quite unlikely (or 'doubtful') that the true percentage is 35%.  However, Option B is a stronger and more direct statement related to the lower bound of the confidence interval implied by the margin of error, making it the better answer in the context of SAT questions focusing on margin of error interpretation.

To scale this up to the city's population of 2 million, we find the proportion of this difference in the sample: 160 / 500.

      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and tests the understanding of margin of error in the context of surveys. The margin of error is inversely related to the square root of the sample size. This means that a smaller sample size will result in a larger margin of error, assuming all other factors (like confidence level and population variability, which are implied to be constant here as 'same method' is used) are equal.Option D, 'Survey P had a smaller sample size,' is the most direct and appropriate reason for Survey P having a larger margin of error compared to Survey Q.Let's analyze why other options are less appropriate or incorrect:* **Option A: Survey P had a smaller number of respondents who completed the entire survey.** This option is related to sample size. A smaller number of completed surveys effectively means a smaller sample size. While technically related and could contribute to a larger margin of error, it is less direct and precise than option D. Option D directly states 'smaller sample size' which is the core statistical concept.  In the context of choosing the *most appropriate* reason, option D is stronger.* **Option B: Survey P had a lower percent of customers reporting satisfaction.** While the percentage of satisfaction can slightly influence the margin of error (as it affects the standard deviation of the sample proportion, which is maximized at 50%), the impact of sample size is generally much more significant.  For a given sample size, the margin of error is largest when the sample proportion is close to 0.5 and smallest when it's close to 0 or 1. However, the question asks for the *most appropriate reason* for a *greater* margin of error, and sample size is the primary and most direct factor influencing margin of error in typical introductory statistical contexts, especially in SAT level questions.  It's less likely that the difference in satisfaction percentage alone would be the *most appropriate* explanation for a larger margin of error when sample sizes could be different.* **Option C: Survey P had a larger sample size.** This option is incorrect because a larger sample size leads to a *smaller* margin of error, not a larger one. This is the opposite of what the question is asking.Therefore, Option D is the most accurate and appropriate reason for Survey P having a larger margin of error. The question is valid, and the marked correct answer is indeed the best answer. The difficulty level 'Hard' is appropriate as it requires understanding of the concept of margin of error and its relationship with sample size."
