      "The question is not clearly written because the values or relationships of P, Q, R, S, and T are not specified. Without these values or relationships, the value of c cannot be uniquely determined.  For the system to have infinitely many solutions, the second equation must be a multiple of the first equation. This means S/P = T/Q = c/R. However, without knowing the values of P, Q, R, S, and T, or at least some relationship between them, we cannot solve for a specific numerical value of c. The question is underspecified and ambiguous.",
      "While option A (c=6) is marked as correct, there is no information provided in the question to definitively arrive at this answer without making assumptions about the values of P, Q, R, S, and T.  For example, if we assume S=2P, T=2Q, and R=3, then for infinite solutions, c must be 2R = 6.  However, these values are not given in the problem statement, making the question flawed.",
      "It is not possible to definitively say that options B, C, and D are clearly incorrect because the question is ambiguous. Depending on the unspecified values of P, Q, R, S, and T, other options could potentially be correct if the intended relationships were different or if there was an error in the question design.",
      "There are no grammatical or formatting issues, but the lack of specific values for P, Q, R, S, and T is a critical issue in the question's clarity and solvability."

      "Options A and C are identical, meaning there are two correct options provided for a single correct answer question. This violates the principle of having only one correct answer in a multiple-choice question. While option C is marked as correct and is indeed correct, option A is also correct and indistinguishable from option C. This makes the question ambiguous and potentially confusing for test-takers."
