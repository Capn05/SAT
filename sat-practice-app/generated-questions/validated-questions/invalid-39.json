      "The question is incomplete as the title of the novel is missing. This lack of context makes the question feel unfinished and less clear than it could be. While 'The novel' as a subject is present, a complete sentence would include the novel's title to provide full context.",
      "While option B ('is') is grammatically correct for the subject 'The novel' in isolation, the missing context could potentially lead to ambiguity in a real test scenario.  Without knowing the full sentence, we are assuming a simple present tense context.",
      "The phrase 'No image' is unclear and irrelevant to the grammatical question. It should be removed as it adds no value and might be confusing.",
      "Although options A, C, and D are grammatically incorrect for the singular subject 'The novel' in a simple present tense context, the lack of a complete sentence makes it slightly less definitively clear why they are wrong in a real-world scenario.  In a complete sentence, the incorrectness would be even more obvious."

      "Option A ('is') is also a grammatically correct and logically sound option, making the question ambiguous. While option D ('has been') might be slightly preferable due to the emphasis on duration implied by 'for millennia,' option A is not clearly incorrect. This makes the question potentially flawed as it may not have a single, definitively correct answer, or the distinction is too subtle for an 'easy' level question."

      "The question, as presented, is a sentence fragment. The second part of the sentence, 'However, many people are unaware that painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the early 16th century,' is grammatically incomplete and lacks a subject and verb to form a complete clause.",
      "While option A ('it was') does grammatically complete the sentence and is the intended correct answer, the original sentence structure is flawed and relies on the test-taker to recognize and correct a pre-existing grammatical error rather than simply identifying the correct word choice within a grammatically sound sentence.",
      "Option B ('she has been') is grammatically incorrect in this context. 'She' could refer to the Mona Lisa, but 'has been painted' implies a present perfect passive voice, suggesting an ongoing or recently completed action, which is not appropriate for describing a historical painting. 'Was painted' (simple past passive) is more suitable.",
      "Option C ('they were') is incorrect because 'they' is plural and does not agree with the singular subject 'Mona Lisa'.",
      "Option D ('one is') is grammatically awkward and less precise than 'it was'. 'One' is vague and doesn't clearly refer back to 'Mona Lisa' as effectively as 'it'. Additionally, 'is painted' (present simple passive) is less appropriate than 'was painted' (simple past passive) for describing a historical event."
