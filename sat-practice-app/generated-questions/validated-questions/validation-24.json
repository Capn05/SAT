To find the original price, we need to understand that the sale price of $36 represents 75% of the original price (100% - 25% discount). Let 'x' be the original price. Then, 0.75x = $36. Solving for x, we get x = $36 / 0.75 = $48. Option C, $48, is indeed the correct answer. Options A, B, and D are incorrect. For example, if the original price was $42 (Option A), a 25% discount would be $42 * 0.25 = $10.50, and the sale price would be $42 - $10.50 = $31.50, not $36. Similarly, checking options B and D will also show they do not result in a sale price of $36. The difficulty level 'Medium' is appropriate as it requires a basic understanding of percentages and setting up a simple equation."

Since the population in 2021 is $z$ times the population in 2019, we have 1.155P = z * P. Dividing both sides by P, we get z = 1.155. Option C, 1.155, is indeed the correct answer. The other options are incorrect. Option A (1.150) is close but incorrect, possibly a distractor based on simply adding the percentages (10% + 5% = 15%). Option B (1.050) only considers the second percentage increase. Option D (1.105) is also incorrect and doesn't represent a logical miscalculation based on the problem description. The difficulty level 'Hard' is appropriate as it requires multiple steps and understanding of percentage increase concepts, which can be challenging for some students."

      "explanation": "The question is clearly written and makes sense. To solve it, we first need to find the value of q. The question states that 'q is 60% less than 35'.  60% of 35 is (60/100) * 35 = 21. Therefore, q = 35 - 21 = 14. Next, the question states that 'p is 150% greater than q'. This means p is equal to q plus 150% of q. 150% of q is (150/100) * q = 1.5 * q = 1.5 * 14 = 21. Therefore, p = q + 21 = 14 + 21 = 35. Option C, which is 35, is indeed the correct answer. Options A, B, and D are incorrect. The difficulty level 'Hard' is appropriate as it requires multiple steps and understanding of percentage concepts."
