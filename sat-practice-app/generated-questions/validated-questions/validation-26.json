Therefore, the angles opposite these sides, ∠PQR and ∠PRQ, are also equal. We are given that ∠QPR = 40°. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. So, ∠PQR + ∠PRQ + ∠QPR = 180°. Since ∠PQR = ∠PRQ, we can rewrite this as 2∠PQR + ∠QPR = 180°. Substituting the given value, we get 2∠PQR + 40° = 180°. Solving for ∠PQR: 2∠PQR = 180° - 40° = 140°, and ∠PQR = 140° / 2 = 70°.

Assuming from typical geometry problems involving intersecting lines that angles x and y are adjacent angles on a straight line, and z is the angle supplementary to the sum of x and y (or adjacent to y on the other side of the straight line), we can use the property that angles on a straight line sum to 180 degrees. If x and y are adjacent angles on a straight line, and z is such that x, y, and z are related to angles on a straight line, a likely interpretation is that x and y are adjacent angles and x + y + z' = 180 for some angle z'. If z is vertically opposite to z', then z = z'.  Therefore, x + y + z = 180. Given x = 50 and y = 60, we have 50 + 60 + z = 180, which simplifies to 110 + z = 180.

In an isosceles triangle PQR with angle P = 20°, there are three possible scenarios based on which sides are equal:\n\nCase 1: PQ = PR. In this case, angle Q = angle R. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, we have 20° + angle Q + angle R = 180°. Substituting angle R = angle Q, we get 20° + 2 * angle Q = 180°, which gives angle Q = 80°.\n\nCase 2: QP = QR. In this case, angle P = angle R = 20°. Then, 20° + angle Q + 20° = 180°, which gives angle Q = 140°.\n\nCase 3: RP = RQ. In this case, angle P = angle Q = 20°. Then, 20° + 20° + angle R = 180°, which gives angle R = 140°. In this case, angle Q = 20°.\n\nTherefore, the possible measures for angle Q are 20°, 80°, and 140°. The option that is NOT a possible measure of angle Q is 40° (Option C).

The interior angles of this triangle are 35 degrees (alternate interior to 'a'), 180 - 'b' = 50 degrees (consecutive interior to 'b'), and an angle vertically opposite to the supplementary angle of 'w'. Let's call the supplementary angle of 'w' as w'. Then, in the triangle, 35 + 50 + w' = 180. This gives w' = 180 - 35 - 50 = 95 degrees.
