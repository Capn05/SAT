      "While option D is marked as correct and is arguably the strongest option among the choices, it relies on an inference that the 'purists overlook crucial aspects of how the bluegrass sound first originated.' This is not explicitly stated in the provided text, making the correctness of option D debatable based solely on the given information.",
      "Options A, B, and C are not definitively incorrect. They present alternative perspectives on the purist viewpoint that could be considered valid depending on further context or interpretation. Option A is a weak argument, but B and C offer reasonable critiques (unrealistic enforcement, missed opportunity for audience growth).",
      "There are formatting issues. The passage ends abruptly with 'Such \\\\\\\\\\ No image', which is not standard or clear. This suggests missing content or a formatting error.",
      "The difficulty level 'Easy' might be inappropriate. While the core concept is understandable, evaluating the nuances of each option and determining the 'most logical' critique requires more than basic comprehension, potentially making it more of a medium difficulty question.",
