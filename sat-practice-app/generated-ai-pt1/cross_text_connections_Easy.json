Digital collections also let small libraries offer far more choices than their shelves could hold.\n\nText 2\n\nWhile she prefers printed books for sustained focus and note-taking, a high school teacher acknowledges that e-books are convenient for travel and quick access to assigned readings. She advises students to choose the format that best fits their purpose.\n\nBased on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?",

      "question_text": "Text 1\n\nA city sustainability office highlights rooftop beekeeping as the most effective step to support urban pollinators. The program has installed 50 honeybee hives and reports strong honey yields and increased community interest in gardening.\n\nText 2\n\nAn urban ecologist cautions that adding managed honeybee hives can increase competition for limited nectar and pollen, stressing native bee species. She argues that the most reliable way to help pollinators is to expand pesticide-free, native flowering habitat; managed hives may play a role, but only alongside habitat improvements.\n\nBased on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the claim in Text 1 that adding more rooftop hives is “the most effective way” to support pollinators?",
