They contend that prospective consent cannot be obtained from future descendants and that current off-target effects and mosaicism present unacceptable uncertainties. The coalition concludes that, given the intergenerational stakes and unresolved governance questions, \"pausing is the only ethically defensible stance at present.\"\n\nText 2\n\nA regulatory scientist argues that categorical bans are counterproductive. Instead, they propose an adaptive, phase-gated framework: strictly limited initial indications (serious monogenic diseases with no alternatives), demanding preclinical evidence thresholds, international oversight, and mandatory long-term registries for all treated lineages. They warn that sweeping moratoria may push research to less scrupulous jurisdictions, reducing transparency and delaying learning under safeguards. The scientist distinguishes somatic from germline interventions and therapy from enhancement, insisting that narrow therapeutic trials can be ethically governed.\n\nBased on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the coalition's assertion that \"pausing is the only ethically defensible stance at present\"?",

      "question_text": "Text 1\n\nA historian cautions that removing contested monuments from civic spaces risks \"erasing\" history. In their view, keeping monuments in place while adding substantial contextual materials—plaques, counter-memorials, and curricula—preserves the past while promoting critical debate. The historian argues that physical presence anchors public memory and prevents simplified narratives.\n\nText 2\n\nA community organizer responds that maintaining monuments that honor oppressive figures imposes ongoing social costs. They argue that context plaques rarely offset the honorific power of a prominent public display. Instead, they support relocating such monuments to museums or study centers, where they can be preserved, interpreted critically, and encountered voluntarily. For the organizer, removal redefines civic space without erasing history.\n\nBased on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to Text 1's claim that removing contested monuments \"erases\" history?",

      "question_text": "Text 1\n\nA macroeconomist defends the centrality of GDP as a policy anchor. While acknowledging its imperfections, they emphasize its cross-country comparability, stability, and association with fiscal capacity and improvements in average health. They warn that proliferating dashboards of alternative metrics can fragment priorities and muddy policy signals; a clear, single target remains essential for growth that lifts living standards.\n\nText 2\n\nA socio-ecological researcher argues that GDP is a poor proxy for welfare. It omits unpaid care, degrades environmental assets by treating resource drawdowns as income, and masks distributional harms. They advocate complementary indicators—distribution-sensitive wellbeing measures and ecological integrity metrics—to steer policy away from growth that amplifies inequality or ecological overshoot.\n\nBased on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely characterize the limitation of relying on GDP, as presented in Text 1?",
