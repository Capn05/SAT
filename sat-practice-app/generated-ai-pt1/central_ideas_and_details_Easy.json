In response, the library launched small pop-up branches in parks and transit hubs, offering book lending, free Wi-Fi, and short digital-skills workshops. Early data show that card sign-ups and circulation have increased in neighborhoods served by these temporary sites. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",

      "question_text": "A neighborhood bakery used to bake many extra pastries for the morning rush, but by afternoon, several trays often went unsold and were discarded. To address this waste, the owner began taking online pre-orders the evening before and adjusted baking quantities based on demand. Within a month, the bakery had fewer leftovers and maintained the same level of customer satisfaction. According to the text, why did the bakery begin taking pre-orders?",

      "question_text": "A museum curator reorganized a gallery by grouping artifacts by theme—such as \"trade,\" \"ritual,\" and \"daily life\"—instead of by date. The new layout included brief explanations connecting objects across different centuries to a common idea. Visitor surveys indicated that people spent more time in the gallery and reported a clearer understanding of the objects' purposes. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
