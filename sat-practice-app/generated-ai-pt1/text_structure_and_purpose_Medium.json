      "question_text": "Municipal planners have embraced urban beekeeping as a way to bolster pollinator populations. Advocates argue that cities offer diverse floral resources and lower exposure to agricultural pesticides than large-scale farms. <u>Yet municipal nectar sources can be unpredictable, with blooms concentrated in brief bursts that leave bees short of food later in the season.</u> In response, some programs stagger plantings and map forage gaps, but these measures are unevenly adopted. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?",

      "question_text": "For much of the twentieth century, restorers cleaned oil paintings with solvent baths, a practice prized for speed but criticized for stripping delicate varnish layers. In recent years, conservators have adapted enzyme-based gels from biochemistry to remove grime more selectively. Early trials in $2015$ at two museums reported stronger color retention and fewer surface abrasions. Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?",

      "question_text": "Open-access journals make articles free to read, often by charging authors an article processing fee. Critics warn that these charges can exclude scholars at underfunded institutions and in low-income countries. Supporters counter that institutional agreements and waivers broaden participation and that the public benefits when paywalls fall. Ultimately, the issue is whether expanding open access can avoid deepening inequities in who gets to publish. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?",
