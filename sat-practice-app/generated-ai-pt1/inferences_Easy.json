During that month, the number of evening visits between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. rose by 40%, while midday visits remained essentially unchanged. Staff reported no new programs or promotions during the trial. These observations most strongly support which inference?",

      "question_text": "In a controlled indoor horticulture study, researchers grew the same plant species under two lighting conditions: standard white LEDs and blue-enriched LEDs. All plants received identical water and nutrients. After six weeks, plants under blue-enriched light had shorter stems and more densely spaced leaves, while plants under standard white light were taller with longer spaces between leaves. Both groups appeared healthy. These findings suggest that  Which choice most logically completes the text?",

      "question_text": "An email service introduced an optional two-step verification feature. Over the next three months, accounts that enabled the feature experienced a 60% reduction in security breaches, and users who enabled it reported an average increase of about 5 seconds in sign-in time. No comparable changes were observed among users who did not enable the feature. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that  Which choice most logically completes the text?",
