Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?",

      "question_text": "While researching public library policies, a student has taken the following notes: \n- In 2019, City A eliminated late fees; circulation in low-income neighborhoods rose 28% in the first year, and the share of items returned within 30 days increased from 67% to 73%.\n- In 2020, City B eliminated late fees; new card sign-ups increased 35%, but the proportion of items 60+ days overdue did not change.\n- In 2021, City C retained late fees but added automatic renewals and text reminders; circulation rose 14%, and items 60+ days overdue fell 9%.\n- A 2023 meta-analysis of 26 systems concluded that removing late fees improves access equity but produces mixed effects on timely returns unless paired with reminders or auto-renewals.\n\nThe student wants to make and support a generalization about how eliminating late fees affects both access and return timeliness.
