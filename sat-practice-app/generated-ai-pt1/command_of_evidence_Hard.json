      "question_text": "A city introduced a weekday morning congestion charge (7:00–10:00) in its central zone. After the policy, average bus speeds within the zone rose by 9% during the charged hours, and car entries fell by 14%. However, the city also implemented signal retiming and opened several bus lanes during the same year. Officials claim that the charge—by directly reducing car entries—caused most of the bus-speed increase, rather than the other changes. Which finding, if true, would most directly support the officials' claim?",
