      "question_text": "An anthropologist returning to a coastal town after a decade away found its annual \"revival\" festival transformed. Young weavers had reintroduced patterns long absent from daily life, learning motifs from museum catalogs and elders' recollections, then modifying them to suit new looms and tourist tastes. Some elders dismissed the event as spectacle, yet the festival proceeds funded language classes and apprenticeships that otherwise would not exist. The anthropologist concluded that \"authenticity\" was a misleading yardstick: the festival did not reconstruct a lost past so much as publicly negotiate a future, staging ancestry to make claims on resources, attention, and continuity. In this reading, fidelity to an unbroken lineage mattered less than the festival's capacity to convene people, practices, and possibilities. Which choice best states the central claim of the text?",

      "question_text": "An economist reviewing data from call centers, software repositories, and patent filings argues that early reports of a productivity surge under widespread remote work captured a transition period shaped by selection effects and temporary buffers (for example, overtime to meet urgent deadlines and the easy gains from reallocated commuting time). As routines stabilized, the economist finds that outcomes diverged: teams with modular tasks, strong documentation norms, and asynchronous workflows often sustained or improved output, while interdependent projects reliant on tacit knowledge exchange saw plateauing or declines. The paper concludes that \"location is a design choice,\" meaning the productivity effects of remote work are contingent on task structure, management practices, and workforce composition, and that blanket policies—whether fully remote or fully on-site—risk misallocating attention and talent. Which statement best captures the author's main conclusion?",

      "question_text": "Sorting a trove of letters, the historian tried to align dates and voices into a clean chronology, only to find that each clarified thread revealed seams of contradiction: a promise recounted as betrayal in another hand, a motive asserted here and denied there. She caught herself smoothing a jagged edge—choosing one version because it made the narrative close neatly—and stopped. \"The shape I prefer,\" she thought, \"is not necessarily the shape that was.\" She left margins in her account where the correspondence refused to converge, marking them not as failures of research but as the residue of human distance and secrecy. Based on the text, which choice best describes the narrator's view of certainty in historical reconstruction?",
