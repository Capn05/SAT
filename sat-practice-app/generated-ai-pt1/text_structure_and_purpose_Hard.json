      "question_text": "Popular accounts credit wolf reintroduction with rapidly reorganizing Yellowstone's ecosystems: elk avoided open valleys, willows rebounded, and streams narrowed. That narrative, however, can obscure variability across space and time. <u>Meta-analyses of park monitoring indicate that while predator-driven \"trophic cascades\" occurred, effect sizes were heterogeneous and, in several watersheds, attenuated after $3$ to $5$ years as ungulates adjusted their foraging strategies.</u> Consequently, recent management plans emphasize habitat context rather than expecting uniform landscape engineering by predators.

      "question_text": "Conventional advice holds that longer emails secure better outcomes because they \"cover all bases.\" An audit of $n=12{,}842$ customer-service threads appeared to confirm this: messages exceeding $\\frac{3}{2}$ standard deviations above the median length correlated with faster resolution. Yet when thread topic complexity—operationalized as the number of distinct issue tags $k$—was controlled for, the pattern weakened and, for high-$k$ cases, reversed. The authors conclude that length per se is a poor predictor; instead, writers should match density to task complexity.  Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?",

      "question_text": "Paleoclimatologists have long debated whether tree rings or cave deposits offer the \"truer\" record of regional rainfall. Critics of dendrochronology argue that rising $CO_2$ can inflate growth independent of moisture, while speleothem advocates note that dripwater chemistry integrates precipitation over time but can lag events by months. Recent reconstructions increasingly employ multiproxy models that assign weights $w_i$ to each record such that $\\sum w_i = 1$, explicitly propagating uncertainties. Rather than declaring a single proxy superior, this approach leverages complementary strengths to recover a more reliable hydroclimate signal.
