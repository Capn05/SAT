3.11

- Using that definition, they determined that Sweden has 24 islands.
The student wants to make and support a generalization about nissologists' definition of an island. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish these goals?

- A. The definition of an island as any piece of land surrounded by water is supported by some nissologists, scientists who study islands.
- B. Multiple counts of Sweden's islands have been based on different definitions of an island.
- C. Based on a recent count, Sweden has a relatively small number of islands with at least 50 permanent residents.
- D. Nissologists' different definitions can result in huge disparities in counts of islands, as the example of Sweden shows.

#### ID: 3dcc7140 Answer

Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The sentence makes a generalization about nissologists' definition of an island specifically, that the use of one definition rather can result in huge disparities in the number of islands counted-and supports that generalization by citing Sweden as an example.

Choice A is incorrect. The sentence introduces one definition of an island to an audience unfamiliar with nissologists; it doesn't make a generalization about nissologists' definition of an island. Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence synthesizes information from the notes about counts of Sweden's islands, it doesn't make and support a generalization about nissoloqists' definition of an island. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence makes an inference about islands in Sweden, it doesn't mention nissologists' definition of an island or make a generalization about it.
