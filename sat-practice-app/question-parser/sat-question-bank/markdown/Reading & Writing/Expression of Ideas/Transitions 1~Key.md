It has long been thought that humans first crossed a land bridge into the Americas approximately 13,000 years ago. based on radiocarbon dating of samples uncovered in Mexico, a research team recently suggested that humans may have arrived more than 30,000 years ago-much earlier than previously thought.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. As a result,

B. Similarly,

C. However,

D. In conclusion,

#### ID: 20733eac Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. "However" logically signals that the theory discussed in this sentence-that humans may have arrived in the Americas over 30,000 years ago-contrasts with the previously discussed theory that humans arrived around 13,000 years ago.

Choice A is incorrect because "as a result" illogically signals that the theory in this sentence is the result of the theory discussed in the previous sentence. Instead, this theory contrasts with the previous one. Choice B is incorrect because "similarly" illogically signals that the theory in this sentence is similar to the theory discussed in the previous sentence. Instead, this theory contrasts with the previous one. Choice D is incorrect because "in conclusion" illogically signals that the theory in this sentence concludes or summarizes the discussion of the previous theory. Instead, this theory contrasts with the previous one.

Researchers believe that pieces of hull found off Oregon's coast are from a Spanish cargo ship that was lost in 1697. Stories passed down among the area's Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians support this belief. _____________________________________________________________________________ describe how blocks of beeswax, an item the ship had been carrying, began washing ashore after the ship was lost.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

- A. For this reason,
- B. For example,
- C. However,
- D. Likewise,

#### ID: f07570bb Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. "For example" logically signals that the Siletz beeswax stories mentioned in this sentence are examples consistent with the previous claim that Siletz stories support the shipwreck theory.

Choice A is incorrect because "for this reason" illogically signals that the Siletz stories about the beeswax were caused by the previous claim that Siletz stories support the shipwreck theory. Instead, the beeswax stories are examples consistent with the claim. Choice C is incorrect because "however" illogically signals that the Siletz stories about the beeswax contrast with the previous claim that Siletz stories support the shipwreck theory. Instead, the beeswax stories are examples consistent with the claim. Choice D is incorrect because "likewise" illygically signals that the Siletz stories about the beeswax are similar to the previous claim that Siletz stories support the shipwreck theory. Instead, the beeswax stories are examples consistent with the claim.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

- A. Regardless,
- B. On the contrary,
- C. Consequently,
- D. For example,

#### ID: 01c8c433 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. "Consequently" logically signals that the postal problems described in this sentence (slow fee collection, heaps of undeliverable mail) were a consequence of the fee system described in the previous sentence.

Choice A is incorrect because "regardless" illogically signals that the postal problems described in this sentence occurred despite the fee system described in the previous sentence. Instead, they were a consequence of that system. Choice B is incorrect because "on the contrary" illogically signals that the postal problems described in this sentence contrast with the fee system described in the previous sentence.

A potter choosing which type of clay to use for a piece considers two key factors: the desired look of the piece and its intended use. ____________ earthenware clay is often used for decorative pieces because of its rustic look. This type of clay is not often used in industrial settings, though, because it is less durable than other clays.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. In other words,

B. Regardless,

C. In conclusion,

D. For example,

#### ID: db8fe023 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The previous sentence tells us that potters think about the look and use of a piece when selecting clay. This sentence provides a specific example of a type of clay selected for its appearance, so the transition "for example" fits perfectly.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea. But this sentence does more than just restate the previous idea. Instead, it provides a more specific example of the idea presented in the first sentence. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence actually agrees with the previous sentences suggest that desired look plays a role in the selection of clay types for pottery pieces. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a concluding transition. But this sentence doesn't sum up the previous sentence. Instead, it gives a specific example of the idea presented in the previous sentence.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. Similarly,

B. For instance,

C. Nevertheless,

D. As a result,

#### ID: 04ad68ca Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. "As a result" logically signals that the thinner, higher walls in this sentence were a result of the invention of flying buttresses in the previous sentence.

Choice A is incorrect because "similarly" illogically signals that the thinner, higher walls in this sentence are similar to the invention of flying buttresses in the previous sentence. Instead, the walls were a result of that invention. Choice B is incorrect because "for instance" illoqically signals that the thinner, higher walls in this sentence are an example supporting the statement about the invention of flying buttresses in the previous sentence.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. In fact,

B. Regardless,

C. Lastly,

D. On the contrary,

#### ID: fc2bcc79 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. "In fact" logically signals that the claim in this sentence—Phoenicia being named after the color purple-emphasizes and supports the previous claim that Phoenicians were famous for using purple dye.

Choice B is incorrect because "regardless" illogically signals that the claim about Phoenicia's with the previous claim that Phoenicians were famous for using purple dye. Instead, the naming emphasizes and supports this claim. Choice C is incorrect because "lastly" illogically signals that the claim about Phoenicia's name is the final step in a process or sequence. Instead, the naming emphasizes and supports the previous claim that Phoenicians were famous for using purple dye. Choice D is incorrect because "on the contrary" illogically signals that the claim about Phoenicia's name directly opposes the previous claim that Phoenicians were famous for using purple dye.

- B. On the contrary,
- C. In addition,
- D. Today,

## ID: 1b219d14 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. "In addition" logically signals that Naff's artifact collecting was separate from, and in addition to, her interviewing.

Choice A is incorrect because "in other words" illoqically signals that the information about Naff's artifact collecting restates the previous information about her interviewing. Instead, Naff collected artifacts in addition to conducting interviews. Choice B is incorrect because "on the contrary" illogically signals that Naff's artifact collecting was contrary to her interviewing. Instead, Naff collected artifacts in addition to conducting interviews. Choice D is incorrect because "today" illogically signals that Naff's artifact collecting is occurring in the present day.

### ID: 47547d07 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. "Next" logically signals that the egg laying in this sentence is the next step in the sequence of events described in the other sentences.

Choice A is incorrect because "by contrast" illogically signals that the egg laying in this sentence contrasts with the nest digging in the previous sentence. Instead, the egg laying follows the nest digging as the next step in the sequence of events. Choice B is incorrect because "similarly" illogically signals that the egg laying in this sentence is similar to the nest digging in the previous sentence. Though the two actions are related, they are not similar. Instead, the egg laying follows the nest digging as the next step in the sequence of events.

Practical movie effects, such as the use of actual locations in a film, provide a more realistic visual experience than computer-generated imagery (CGI) does, but giving audiences the "real thing" can be prohibitively expensive. many filmmakers use a blended approach, employing practical effects whenever possible and CGI elements as necessary to control costs.

- A. Similarly,
- B. For this reason,
- C. Furthermore,
- D. In other words,

## ID: b7571c0a Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The first sentence tells us that practical effects are more realistic but also more expensive than CGI. The second sentence tells us that many filmmakers use both kinds of effects, balancing realism with cost. To connect these ideas, we need a cause-and-effect transition, like "therefore." "For this reason" has the same meaning as "therefore." .

Choice A is incorrect. This isn't a logical transition. The first sentence tells us that practical effects are more realistic but also more expensive than CGI. The second sentence tells us that many filmmakers use both kinds of effects, balancing realism with cost.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. For example,

B. However,

C. Specifically,

D. Similarly,

#### ID: 0ee64efc Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. "However" is used to indicate a contrast between two ideas. The first sentence describes how Still used to be famous. This sentence describes how Still is not very famous today, so the transition "however" fits perfectly.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that introduces an example. But the second sentence doesn't provide a specific example of Still's famous contributions to the Underground Railroad. Instead, it changes the subject to how his fame has faded over time. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that introduces an example or continuation of a previous idea. But the second sentence doesn't provide a specific example of Still's famous contributions to the Underground Railroad. It changes the subject to how his fame has faded over time. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the agreement between two ideas. But this sentence shows a contrast with the first sentence—namely, that Still used to be very famous but now isn't very famous.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. Then,

B. In fact,

C. Likewise,

- D. For example,
### ID: 63c73b50 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. "Then" indicates that the events in this sentence took place after the events in the previous sentence. Only after users upload imaqes of unknown soldiers can those images be analyzed.

Choice B is incorrect. This transition is used to emphasize the truth of a statement that modifies the previous statement. But this sentence doesn't modify the step described in the previous statement: instead, it introduces an entirely new step in the process. So "in fact" wouldn't make sense here. Choice O is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of a new but related idea, which doesn't make sense here. Analyzing the physical features in the uploaded photographs isn't a similar idea, but rather the next step in the process. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn't make sense here. Analyzing physical features is not an example of uploading and tagging an image.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. Earlier,

B. However,

C. Next,

D. As a result,

#### ID: 3831f2d7 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. This choice uses a transition that indicates a shift back in time. Since the first sentence talks about Thaden's race win in 1929 and the second shifts back to talking about her record in 1928, this makes the most sense here.

Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence actually agrees with and expands on the previous sentence by describing the earlier record that Thaden had "already" held. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a shift forward in time, which doesn't make sense here. A record in 1928 didn't come after Thaden's race win in 1929. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn't make sense in this context-an event in 1929 can't cause something in 1928.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

- A. For example,
- B. For this reason,
- C. Nowadays,
- D. Similarly,

### ID: 2b5e0731 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. "For this reason" is a cause-and-effect transition. The cause in this case is that the mother elephant wants to know that her calf is safe, so the effect is that she lets out an infrasonic call for the calf to hear. Therefore, "for this reason" fits perfectly in this context.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that introduces an example of a previous idea. But the second sentence doesn't provide an example of the events described in the first sentence. Instead, it describes what happens next: the mother elephant calls for her calf. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a shift from the past to the current time, which doesn't make sense here. Both sentences use the present tense, as they're describing the same time period. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates commonality or agreement between two ideas.

- A. In other words,
- B. Similarly,
- C. Therefore,
- D. By comparison,

#### ID: 1c36e3e1 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The first sentence claims that the number of sunspots can vary greatly. To support this claim, the next two sentences compare two examples: one time when there were 180 sunspots and one time when there were only 2 sunspots. So the transition "by comparison" fits perfectly.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea, which doesn't make sense here. This sentence doesn't restate the first example-it describes a totally different example. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of a similar idea, which doesn't make sense here. This sentence describes a second example that is very different from the first example.

A. As a result,

D. Earlier,

#### ID: ac8eb085 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The second sentence describes a consequence of the system laid out in the first sentence: because air is owned and sold by companies in this world, people have to buy it.

Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that means "no matter what happens" or "whatever the situation is," which doesn't make sense here. There's only one situation described in the text: a fictional world in which companies own all the breathable air, forcing people to buy it. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn't disagree with the previous sentence. They both describe the same fictional situation. Choice D is incorrect.

- A. In the first place,
- B. On the other hand,
- C. For this reason,
- D. In comparison,

### ID: 37957752 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. "For this reason" logically signals that the behavior described in this sentence is a consequence of the information about seals in the previous sentence. That is, a seal moves its flippers as little as possible during a deep dive because it needs to keep its heart rate low enough that it does not run out of oxygen.

Choice A is incorrect because "in the first place" illogically signals that this sentence is the first point in a discussion. Instead, the sentence describes a behavior that is a consequence of the previous information about seals. Choice B is incorrect because "on the other hand" illogically signals that the behavior described in this sentence contrasts with the previous information about seals. Instead, it is a consequence of that information. Choice D is incorrect because "in comparison" illogically signals that the behavior described in this sentence is being compared to the previous information about seals. Instead, it is a consequence of that information.

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. "By contrast" loqically signals that the finding described in this sentence contrasts with the finding described in the previous sentence.

Choice A is incorrect because "for example" illogically signals that the finding described in this sentence is an example of the finding described in the previous sentence. Instead, it contrasts with that finding. Choice B is incorrect because "specifically" illogically signals that this sentence provides specific, precise details about the finding described in the previous sentence.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. However,

B. In conclusion,

C. Later,

D. In other words,

#### ID: 4154a7a3 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. "Later" logically signals that the event discussed in this sentence-the creation of the short film featuring Fuller's dance—is a related event that occurred after the event discussed in the previous sentence (the 1891 debut of the dance).

Choice A is incorrect because "however" illogically signals that the information in this sentence contrasts with the information in the previous sentence. Instead, the creation of the short film is a related event that followed the event discussed in the previous sentence. Choice B is incorrect because "in conclusion" illogically signals that the information in this sentence concludes or summarizes the information in the previous sentence. Instead, the creation of the short film is a related event that followed the event discussed in the previous sentence. Choice D is incorrect because "in other words" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a paraphrase or restatement of the information in the previous sentence. Instead, the creation of the short film is a related event that followed the event discussed in the previous sentence.

Riley Black-the author of critically acclaimed books such as My Beloved Brontosaurus (2013)—is best known for writing about dinosaurs, but she has also conducted hands-on fieldwork. _________ her fieldwork has included paleontological digs in Utah, Montana, and Wyoming, and her dinosaur fossil discoveries can be seen at places such as the Carnegie Museum of Natural History.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

- A. Regardless,
- B. Subsequently,
- C. Specifically,
- D. Conversely,

#### ID: d3898d32 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The second sentence provides more specific information about the fieldwork mentioned in the first sentence-that the paleontological digs took place in Utah, Montana, and Wyoming. Therefore, "specifically" fits perfectly in this context.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn't disagree with the previous sentence. Rather, this sentence agrees with and elaborates on the last sentence by providing more specifics about the fieldwork Black does. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates that an event took place after another event. But the two sentences are not describing different events-instead, this sentence gives more details about the first sentence. Choice D is incorrect. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn't disagree with the previous sentence. Rather, this sentence agrees with and elaborates on the last sentence by providing more specifics about the fieldwork Black does.

Laetitia Ky's hair is her art. Inspired by hairstyles from various African tribes, the Ivorian artist uses wire and thread to sculpt her hair into all kinds of shapes. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Africa-including the island of Madagascar!

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

A. Soon,

B. Elsewhere,

C. For example,

D. However,

#### ID: 6916c8e5 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. "For example" logically signals that the following information about Ky—that she once shaped her hair to look like Africa—is an example supporting the previous statement that she makes different shapes with her hair.

Choice A is incorrect because "soon" illogically signals that the event described in this sentence occurred soon after the statement about Ky making different shapes with her hair. Instead, the sentence provides an example of one of these shapes. Choice B is incorrect because "elsewhere" illogically signals that the event described in this sentence occurred in a different place than the statement about Ky making different shapes with her hair. Instead, the sentence provides an example of one of these shapes. Choice D is incorrect because "however" illogically signals that the information in this sentence contrasts with the statement that Ky makes different shapes with her hair. Instead, the sentence provides an example of one of these shapes.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

- A. With this in mind,
- B. On the contrary,
- C. In conclusion,
- D. Regardless,

### ID: de0bcf4f Answer

#### Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. "With this in mind" logically signals that the activity described in this sentence-Dominquez's use of techniques like decalcomania to produce unpredictable abstract patterns—is a result of his desire to include random elements in his art.

Choice B is incorrect. "On the contrary" illogically signals that the activity in this sentence opposes or is contrary to Dominguez's desire to use random elements in his art. Instead, his use of decalcomania is a result of that desire. Choice C is incorrect. "In conclusion" illogically signals that the activity in this sentence is a conclusion or summary of Dominguez's desire to use random elements in his art. Instead, his use of decalcomania is a result of that desire. Choice D is incorrect. "Regardless" illogically signals that the activity in this sentence occurs desire to use random elements in his art. Instead, his use of decalcomania is a result of that desire.

Following the Mata Ortiz pottery technique, Mexican sculptor Juan Quezada Celado starts by creating the base of the pot with a slab of clay. ____ he builds the pot walls by layering coils of clay around the perimeter of the base. Celado then smooths out the pot's walls with a hacksaw blade. At last, the pot is ready to be painted.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

- A. For example,
- B. However,
- C. By contrast,
- D. Next,

### ID: b5a399f1 Answer

#### Correct Answer: D

### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. "Next" logically signation in this sentence-which explains how Celado builds the pot's walls-is the next step in Celado's pot creation process. The sentences that follow further signal this information by completing the process.

Choice A is incorrect because "for example" illogically signals that the information about Celado building pot walls in this sentence exemplifies the information in the previous sentence about how Celado's pot creation process begins. Instead, it is the next step in this process. Choice B is incorrect because "however" illogically signals that the information in this sentence contrasts with the information in the previous sentence about how Celado's pot creation process begins. Instead, it is the next step in this process.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

- A. Thus,
- B. However,
- C. For example,
- D. Second of all,

### ID: bfb4e85e Answer

#### Correct Answer: B

### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. "However" logically signals that the information in this sentence-that nothing in Copeland's career matches her accomplishment of being the first African American woman named principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre—offers a contrast or exception to the previous information about Copeland's accomplishments.

Choice A is incorrect because "thus" illogically signals that follows is a result of the previous information about Copeland's accomplishments. Instead, the statement that nothing in Copeland's career matches this accomplishment offers a contrast or exception to that information. Choice C is incorrect because "for example" illogically signals that Copeland's statement about her greatest accomplifies the claim about her accomplishments in the previous sentence. Instead, it offers a contrast or exception to that information. Choice D is incorrect because "second of all" illogically signals that the information is a second, separate claim from the previous sentence's information about her accomplishments.

- B. Previously,
- C. In other words,
- D. However,

## ID: c4f7f726 Answer

#### Correct Answer: D

### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. "However" logically signals that the information in this sentence about butterfly species-that some have colorless, transparent with the previous information about butterfly species with bold, colorful wings.

Choice A is incorrect because "similarly" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is similar to the previous information about butterfly species. Instead, it contrasts with the previous information. Choice B is incorrect because "previously" illogically signals that this sentence describes an event that occurred before another event.

- B. In other words,
- C. That said,
- D. For instance,

However, only about 730,000 people live in the state of Alaska. ______________________________________________________________________ Alaska has just one House district, encompassing the entire state.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

- A. As a result,
- B. Instead,
- C. Finally,
- D. For instance,

# ID: 7f20374f Answer

### Correct Answer: A

## Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. "As a result" logically signals that the information in the sentence-that, in the US House of Representatives, the entire state of Alaska has just one district—is the result or consequence of Alaska having only about 730,000 people. This is slightly below the average for House districts, which are roughly equal populations.

Choice B is incorrect because "instead" illogically signals that Alaska having just one state district is an alternative to the information about the state's population in the previous sentence. Rather, the fact that Alaska has just one district is a result or consequence of the entire state having slightly fewer people than an average-sized district. Choice C is incorrect because "finally" illogically signals that the information in this sentence about Alaska having just one district indicates a last step in a process or a concluding summary. Instead, the fact that Alaska has just one district is a result or consequence of the entire state having slightly fewer people than an average-sized district. Choice D is incorrect because "illogically signals that the information in this sentence about Alaska having just one district exemplifies the information about the state's population in the previous sentence. Instead, the fact that Alaska has just one district is a result or consequence of the entire state having slightly fewer people than an average-sized district.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

- A. in turn,
- B. likewise,
- C. nevertheless,
- D. in reality,

### ID: 1996c104 Answer

#### Correct Answer: A

### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. "In turn" loqically signals that the information in the sentence—that the electrical currents create a protective barrier around Earth-is a result or consequence of the previous information about the circulation of liquid metals generating electrical currents that flow between Earth's magnetic poles.

Choice B is incorrect because "likewise" illogically signals that the information in the previous information about the circulation of liquid metals generating electrical currents that flow between Earth's magnetic poles. Instead, the new information about the electrical currents is a direct result or consequence of the previous information. Choice C is incorrect because "nevertheless" illogically signals that the information in the sentence is true despite the previous information about the circulation of liguid metals generating electrical currents that flow between Earth's magnetic poles. Instead, the new information about the electrical currents is a direct result or consequence of the previous information. Choice D is incorrect because "in reality" illogically signation in the sentence contradiots the previous information about the circulation of liquid metals generating electrical currents that flow between Earth's magnetic poles. Instead, the new information about the electrical currents is a direct result or consequence of the previous information.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?

- A. Additionally,
- B. For example,
- C. Nevertheless,
- D. Today,

# ID: 42d92dea Answer

### Correct Answer: D

## Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. "Today" logically signals that the information in the sentence-that the museum is able to display close to 30% of its collection-is true of the Art Institute of Chicago as it exists in the previously mentioned unveiling of the massive new gallery in 2009.

Choice A is incorrect because "additionally" illogically signals that the information is merely an additional fact related to the information about the museum before the new gallery opened. Instead, the museum in the present day after the new gallery opened. Choice B is incorrect because "for example" illogically signals that the information in the sentence exemplifies the previous information about the museum before the new gallery opened. Instead, the sentence is about the museum in the present day after the new gallery opened. Choice C is incorrect because "nevertheless" illogically signals that the information in the sentence is true despite the previous information about the museum before the new gallery opened. Instead, the sentence is about the museum in the present day after the new gallery opened.
