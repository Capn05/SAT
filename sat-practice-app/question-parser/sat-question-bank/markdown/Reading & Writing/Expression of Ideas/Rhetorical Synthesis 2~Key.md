Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. This choice contrasts McKay's fame as a Harlem Renaissance writer with his earlier achievements as a Jamaican poet, and it names the two collections he published before moving to Harlem.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn't emphasize McKay's accomplishments before moving to Harlem. It lists some of his works but doesn't distinquish between those he wrote in Jamaica and those he wrote in Harlem. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn't emphasize McKay's accomplishments before moving to Harlem. It only mentions the year he moved and what he would become known for afterwards. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn't emphasize McKay's accomplishments before moving to Harlem. It mentions that he lived in Jamaica, but it doesn't name any of the works he published there.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- · Architect Julian Abele studied Gregorian and neo-Gothic architecture in Europe.
- Abele worked for an architecture firm that was hired in 1924 to design buildings for Duke University's new campus.
- Most of the buildings on Duke's campus were designed in the Gregorian or neo-Gothic architectural styles.
- · At the time, Abele was not formally credited with designing the buildings.
- · Based on the buildings' architectural styles, historians believe Abele designed most of the campus buildings.

The student wants to specify why historians believe Abele designed most of Duke's campus buildings. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

- A. Given that most of the buildings on Duke's campus feature architectural styles that Abele had studied in Europe, historians believe Abele is the one who designed them.
- B. Though Abele wasn't formally credited at the time, historians believe he designed most of the buildings on Duke's campus.
- C. Most of Duke's campus buildings, which were designed by a firm Abele worked for, were designed in the Gregorian and neo-Gothic architectural styles.
- D. Abele, an architect who studied Gregorian and neo-Gothic architecture in Europe, is believed to have designed most of the buildings on Duke's campus.

#### ID: 7aac173e Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The sentence specifies why historians believe Abele designed most of Duke's campus buildings, noting that most of the buildings feature architectural styles that Abele had studied.

Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence explains that historians believe Abele designed most of Duke's campus buildings, it doesn't specify why historians hold that belief. Choice C is incorrect because the sentence emphasizes the architectural styles of Duke's campus buildings; it doesn't specify why historians believe Abele designed the buildings. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence explains that Abele is believed to have designed most of the buildings on Duke's campus, it doesn't specify why historians believe that he designed the buildings.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- · In geology, an Aeolian landform is one that has been created by the wind.
- · In Greek mythology, Aeolus is the keeper of the winds.
- Aeolian landforms are created when the wind erodes, transports, or deposits material.
- · A mushroom rock is a rock formation in which the top is wider than the base.
- · A mushroom rock can be formed when the wind erodes the base and the top at different rates.

The student wants to provide an example of Aeolian landforms. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

- A. Aeolian landforms are created by different wind-based processes; for example, some are created by wind erosion.
- B. Aeolian landforms—landforms created by the wind—include the mushroom rock, a rock formation in which the wind erodes the base of the rock faster than the top.
- C. Erosion, transportation, and deposition are three examples of how the wind can create Aeolian landforms and mushroom rocks.
- D. A mushroom rock is a rock formation that owes its shape to the wind, a natural force associated with Aeolus in Greek mythology.

### ID: 34e1124f Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The sentence provides an explanation and an example of Aeolian landforms, explaining that they are landforms created by wind and offering the mushroom rock as an example.

Choice A is incorrect. The sentence explains that Aeolian landforms are created by wind but does not provide an example of any specific Aeolian landforms. Rather, the example it provides is of a wind-based process. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence provides a partial explanation of Aeolian landforms, noting that they are created by the wind, it does not effectively provide an example. The sentence seems to indicate that mushroom rocks, rather than being an example of Aeolian landforms, are distinct from them. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence provides an explanation of a mushroom rock, which is a specific example of an Aeolian landform, it doesn't provide an explanation of Aeolian landforms in general.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- · J.R.R. Tolkien's 1937 novel The Hobbit features two maps.
- · The novel opens with a reproduction of the map that the characters use on their quest.
- This map introduces readers to the fictional world they are about to enter.
- The novel closes with a map depicting every stop on the characters' journey.
- · That map allows readers to reconstruct the story they have just read.

The student wants to contrast the purposes of the two maps in The Hobbit. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

- A. The Hobbit's opening map introduces readers to the fictional world they are about to enter, while the closing map allows them to reconstruct the story they have just read.
- B. The Hobbit, a novel published by J.R.R. Tolkien in 1937, features a reproduction of a map that the characters use on their quest, as well as a map that appears at the end of the novel.
- C. The Hobbit's two maps, one opening and one closing the novel, each serve a purpose for readers.
- D. In 1937, author J.R.R. Tolkien published The Hobbit, a novel featuring both an opening and a closing map.

### ID: ce282575 Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The sentence contrasts the purposes of the two maps in The Hobbit, noting that the opening map introduces readers to the book's fictional world, while the closing map helps readers reconstruct the story. The word "while" helps signal a contrast between the purposes of the maps.

Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence mentions the two maps, it doesn't contrast the maps' purposes. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence mentions the two maps and notes that each has a purpose, it doesn't specify what those purposes are or how they contrast. Choice D is incorrect.

- · Her leporello December from My Window (1993) features a panoramic landscape.
- It is painted using ink and watercolor.

The student wants to describe Adnan's December from My Window to an audience already familiar with leporellos. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

- A. Featuring a panoramic landscape, the 1993 work is one of Adnan's many leporellos, which are accordion-style folded books that when expanded reveal the artist's work.
- B. When expanded, Adnan's 1993 leporello December from My Window reveals a panoramic landscape painted in ink and watercolor.
- C. Known for making many other accordion-style folded books called leporellos, Adnan created December from My Window in 1993.
- D. A leporello, such as Adnan's December from My Window, is folded accordion style, and due to its zigzag shape it is able to stand on its own when fully expanded.

### ID: 1469d23a Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. This choice describes Adnan's December from My Window in a way that assumes the audience is already familiar with leporellos and focuses on the specific features of the work-its content and medium.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice isn't suited for an audience already familiar with leporellos. A familiar audience wouldn't need to have the term defined or explained. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn't describe Adnan's December from My Window. It mentions the year and the type of work but not the medium. In addition, it provides a simple definition of leporellos, making this an inappropriate choice for an audience already familiar with leporellos. Choice D is incorrect. This choice isn't suited for an audience already familiar with leporellos. A familiar audience wouldn't need to have the term defined.

- A. In 2006, artists Ed Gomez and Luis Hernandez founded the MexiCali Biennial, which has taken place in 2006, 2009-10, 2013, and 2018–20.
- B. Unlike traditional biennials, the MexiCali Biennial hosts exhibitions in different venues on an uneven schedule.
- C. The term biennial traditionally refers to an art exhibition that takes place every two years in a single location, not to exhibitions hosted at a variety of times and venues.
- D. Biennial exhibitions have been held in New York, Berlin, and Venice but also on both sides of the US-Mexico border.

### ID: 3ea7372e Answer

Correct Answer: B

### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The sentence effectively emphasizes a difference between the MexiCali Biennial and traditional biennials, stating that the MexiCali Biennial is unlike traditional biennials because it hosts exhibitions in different venues on an uneven schedule.

Choice A is incorrect. The sentence indicates who founded the MexiCali Biennial and the years this biennial has taken place; it doesn't emphasize a difference between the MexiCali Biennial and traditional biennials. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence clarifies the traditional meaning of biennial with language that could apply to the MexiCali Biennial, it doesn't mention the MexiCali Biennial by name. Therefore, the sentence doesn't effectively emphasize a difference between the MexiCali Biennial and traditional biennials. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence notes locations where various biennial exhibitions have been held; it doesn't emphasize a difference between the MexiCali Biennial and traditional biennials.

The student wants to make and support a generalization about the effect of redesigning a city flag. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

- A. Over one hundred US cities have redesigned their flags, including Pocatello, whose flag had been named the most poorly designed flag in North America.
- B. Pocatello is just one of over one hundred US cities that have redesigned their flags.
- C. After it was named the most poorly designed flag in North America, the flag of Pocatello was redesigned to better represent the city's geography and civic priorities.
- D. Redesigning a poorly designed city flag can create a meaningful symbol of civic pride, as was the case when Pocatello redesigned its original flag to better represent its geography and civic priorities.

#### ID: efc19153 Answer

#### Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The sentence makes and supports a generalization about the effect of redesigning a city flaq, noting that redesigning a city flaq can create a meaningful symbol of civic pride, as was the case when the city of Pocatello redesigned its flaq.

Choice A is incorrect because the sentence explains that many US cities have redesigned their flags and provides an example; it doesn't make and support a generalization about the effect of redesigning a city flag. Choice B is incorrect because the sentence provides an example of a city that redesigned its flag; it doesn't make and support a generalization about the effect of redesigning a city flag.

- A. Wisconsin, which doesn't take size into account in defining a lake, claims that it has over 15,000 lakes.
- B. Because its definition of a lake is different from Minnesota's, it is unclear how many lakes Wisconsin really has.
- C. According to Minnesota's definition of a lake-an inland body of water of at least 10 acres-Wisconsin has about 6,000 lakes.
- D. Minnesota's definition of a lake-an inland body of water of at least 10 acres-is more restrictive than Wisconsin's, which doesn't take size into account.

#### ID: 835b101b Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The sentence contrasts Minnesota's definition of a lake with Wisconsin's, explaining that Minnesota's definition (which takes size into account) is more restrictive than Wisconsin's definition (which doesn't).

Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence notes that Wisconsin's definition of a lake doesn't take size into account, it doesn't contrast Minnesota's definition with Wisconsin's. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence states that Wisconsin's definition of a lake is different from Minnesota's, but it doesn't clarify how they differ. In other words, it doesn't contrast Minnesota's definition with Wisconsin's. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence indicates how many lakes Wisconsin has according to Minnesota's definition of a lake, but it doesn't clarify how the states' definitions differ.

- B. Tubbs's work, which often features discarded objects, has been shown both within the United States and abroad.
- C. Like many of Tubbs's sculptures, both Erasure and Home Grown include discarded objects: Erasure uses audiocassette tapes, and Home Grown uses plastic forks.
- D. Tubbs completed Erasure in 2008 and Home Grown in 2009.

#### ID: 92dec236 Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. This choice most effectively emphasizes "a similarity" by identifying a trait the works share: "both Erasure and Home Grown include discarded objects."

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn't "emphasize a similarity" Instead, this choice shows how the materials used in the two works are different. Notice the use of the contrast word "however." Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn't "emphasize a similarity between the two works" While it says that Tubbs's work "often features discarded objects," it doesn't provide details about the two works in question. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn't "emphasize a similarity." Instead, this choice shows how the works were produced at different times.

Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence provides a quotation from Acquah, the quotation illustrates Acqual's views on Ghanaian women; the sentence doesn't explain why Acquah used pointillism in her painting.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

Crown shyness is a phenomenon in which the tops (crowns) of neighboring trees grow close together but don't overlap.

To explain how this happens, Australian forester M.R. Jacobs proposes the mutual abrasion theory.

According to Jacobs's theory, when trees brush against one another, branches break off.

Malaysian scholar Francis S.P. Ng posits the mutual shade avoidance theory.

According to Ng's theory, when tree branches detect shade from nearby trees' branches, they stop growing.

The student wants to compare the causes of crown shyness proposed in the two theories. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?

While Jacobs proposes that crown shyness is caused by neighboring tree branches brushing against one another, Ng A. posits that it occurs when branches detect shade from nearby trees' branches.

B. Both Jacobs and Ng have proposed theories to explain what causes crown shyness.

C. Ng posits the mutual shade avoidance theory, whereas Jacobs proposes an alternative theory.

Jacobs's mutual abrasion theory proposes that when neighboring trees brush against one another, branches break off, D. resulting in a phenomenon in which the tops of trees grow close together but don't overlap.
