3.1

The field of study called affective neuroscience seeks instinctive, physiological causes for feelings such as pleasure or displeasure. Because these sensations are linked to a chemical component (for example, the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain when one receives or expects a reward), they can be said to have a partly physiological basis. These processes have been described in mammals, but Jingnan Huang and his colleagues have recently observed that some behaviors of honeybees (such as foraging) are also motivated by a dopamine-based signaling process.

What choice best describes the main purpose of the text?

- A. It describes an experimental method of measuring the strength of physiological responses in humans.
- B. It illustrates processes by which certain insects can express how they are feeling.
- C. It summarizes a finding suggesting that some mechanisms in the brains of certain insects resemble mechanisms in mammalian brains.
- D. It presents research showing that certain insects and mammals behave similarly when there is a possibility of a reward for their actions.

### ID: 82cb7dda Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to summarize a finding suggesting that some mechanisms in the brains of certain insects resemble mechanisms in mammalian brains. The text begins by explaining that feelings such as pleasure and displeasure are linked to chemical processes in the brain, such as the release of dopamine when one receives a reward. The text then indicates that such processes have been seen in mammals but that researchers have recently observed similar processes involving dopamine in honeybees. Taken together, this information serves to sum up the discovery that some mechanisms in the brains of certain insects may resemble mechanisms linked to feelings such as pleasure and displeasure in mammals.

Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't describe any experimental methods. Instead, the text describes a phenomenon that has been observed in mammals and then presents the recent observations of Huang and colleagues that this phenomenon is also seen in honeybees. Choice B is incorrect because there's nothing in the text to suggest that certain insects can express how they're feeling through particular processes. The text does indicate that certain honeybee behaviors such as foraging are linked to dopamine, but it doesn't suggest that these behaviors enable honeybees to communicate feelings or sensations. Choice D is incorrect because the text presents research showing that certain honeybee behaviors such as foraging are linked to dopamine and therefore may be motivated by similar mechanisms to those in mammalian brains, not that honeybees and mammals behave similarly when there is the possibility of reward for their actions.

3.2

Studying late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century artifacts from an agricultural and domestic site in Texas, archaeologist Ayana O. Flewellen found that Black women employed as farm workers utilized hook-and-eye closures to fasten their clothes at the waist, giving themselves a silhouette similar to the one that was popular in contemporary fashion and typically achieved through more restrictive garments such as corsets. Flewellen argues that this sartorial practice shows that these women balanced hegemonic ideals of femininity with the requirements of their physically demanding occupation.

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

- A. To describe an unexpected discovery that altered a researcher's view of how rapidly fashions among Black female farmworkers in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Texas changed during the period
- B. To discuss research that investigated the ways in which Black female farmworkers in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Texas used fashion practices to resist traditional gender ideals
- C. To evaluate a scholarly work that offers explanations for the impact of urban fashion ideals on Black female farmworkers in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Texas
- D. To summarize the findings of a study that explored factors influencing a fashion practice among Black female farmworkers in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Texas

### ID: d4732483 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The text provides an overview of a scholarly work discussing the fashion practices of Black female farmworkers in late 19th- and early 20th-century Texas, and how these practices were influenced by both the fashion ideals of the time and the demands of farmwork.

Choice A is incorrect. The text never discusses the rate of fashion change among Black female farmworkers. The text also never categorizes Flewellen's findings as "unexpected." Choice B is incorrect. The text actually explains that Black female farmworkers were trying to achieve traditional feminine ideals, not resist them. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn't evaluate a scholarly work but rather simply describes it. Furthermore, the text is focused on "agricultural and domestic" fashion, not urban fashion as this choice suggests.

3.3

The following text is adapted from Herman Melville's 1857 novel The Confidence-Man. Humphry Davy was a prominent British chemist and inventor.

Years ago, a grave American savant, being in London, observed at an evening party there, a certain coxcombical fellow, as he thought, an absurd ribbon in his lapel, and full of smart [banter], whisking about to the admiration of as many as were disposed to admire. Great was the savant's disdain; but, chancing ere long to find himself in a corner with the jackanapes, got into conversation with him, when he was somewhat ill-prepared for the good sense of the jackanapes, but was altogether thrown aback, upon subsequently being [informed that he was] no less a personage than Sir Humphry Davy.

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

- A. It portrays the thoughts of a character who is embarrassed about his own behavior.
- B. It presents an account of a misunderstanding.
- C. It offers a short history of how a person came to be famous.
- D. It explains why one character dislikes another.

### ID: b0f7541b Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The text tells a story of a first impression that turned out to be wrong: a serious American savant was dismissive of a goofy-looking, wisecracking quest at a British party, and then was shocked to learn that the quest was actually a prominent British chemist and inventor.

Choice A is incorrect. This is too strong and too narrow. Only at the savant "thrown aback" by the fact that the man was Sir Humphry Davy-he's not "embarrassed about his own behavior." Choice C is incorrect. This isn't the main purpose. The text never provides the history of how Sir Humphry Davy came to be famous. Nor does it provide any history for the American savant. Choice D is incorrect. This is too narrow. It doesn't include the second half of the text, where the savant gets into a conversation with the man and then finds out that the man is Sir Humphry Davy.

3.4

Some studies have suggested that posture can influence cognition, but we should not overstate this phenomenon. A case in point: In a 2014 study, Megan O'Brien and Alaa Ahmed had subjects stand or sit while making risky simulated economic decisions. Standing is more physically unstable and cognitively demanding than sitting; accordingly, O'Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that standing subjects would display more risk aversion during the decision-making tasks than sitting subjects did, since they would want to avoid further feelings of discomfort and complicated risk evaluations. But O'Brien and Ahmed actually found no difference in the groups' performance.

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

- A. It argues that research findings about the effects of posture on cognition are often misunderstood, as in the case of O'Brien and Ahmed's study.
- B. It presents the study by O'Brien and Ahmed to critique the methods and results reported in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition.
- C. It explains a significant problem in the emerging understanding of posture's effects on cognition and how O'Brien and Ahmed tried to solve that problem.
- D. It discusses the study by O'Brien and Ahmed to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about the effects of posture on coqnition.

### ID: c61a7c4a Answer

Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text notes that although some studies have suggested that posture may have an effect on cognition, this phenomenon should not be overstated. In other words, the text begins by urqing caution and restraint when discussing the effects of posture on cognition, implying that even though some studies have shown posture to affect cognition, we should not assume that posture always affects cognition or does so in a strong way. The text goes on to discuss O'Brien and Ahmed's study as a "case in point" (that is, as an example of the point made previously). According to the text, O'Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that since standing is more cognitively demanding than sitting, standing subjects in their experiment would respond differently to decision-making tasks than sitting subjects would show an effect of posture on cognition. What the researchers actually found, however, was that the standing and sitting subjects performed the same-posture did not affect cognition. By presenting a circumstance in which posture does not affect cognition, the discussion of O'Brien and Ahmed's study shows why it is important not to overstate the phenomenon. The purpose of the text, therefore, is to discuss O'Brien and Ahmed's study to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about posture's effects on cognition.

{5}------------------------------------------------

Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses O'Brien and Ahmed's study as an example of why caution is needed when discussing posture's effects on cognition, not as an example of how research findings related to posture and cognition are often misunderstood. Although the text does warn against misunderstanding the scope of the relationship between posture and cognition that has been reported in some previous studies, O'Brien and Ahmed's study is not one of those studies, and there is no suggestion that anyone has misunderstood O'Brien and Ahmed's findings. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the methods used in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition. Although the text does urge caution when discussing posture's effects on cognition, it does not critique the results of studies that suggested that posture can affect cognition. Instead, the text suggests that such results should not be exaggerated or taken too broadly. Choice C is incorrect because although the text implies that overstating posture's effects on cognition would be a problem, nothing in the text suggests that O'Brien and Ahmed share that view or that they attempted to solve that problem. O'Brien and Ahmed are presented as hypothesizing that posture would affect cognition in their study, not as trying to resolve the problem the text describes.

3.5

In Jane Austen's novel Mansfield Park, an almost imperceptible smile from potential suitor Henry Crawford causes the protagonist Fanny Price to blush; her embarrassment grows when she suspects that he is aware of it. This moment—in which Fanny not only infers Henry's mental state through his gestures, but also infers that he is drawing inferences about her mental state—illustrates what literary scholar George Butte calls "deep intersubjectivity," a technique for representing interactions between consciousnesses through which Austen's novels derive much of their social and psychological drama.

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?

- A. It states a claim about Austen's skill at representing psychological complexity that is reinforced by an example presented in the following sentence.
- B. It advances an interpretation of an Austen protagonist who is contrasted with protagonists from other Austen novels cited in the following sentence.
- C. It describes a recurring theme in Auster's novels that is the focus of a literary scholar's analysis summarized in the following sentence.
- D. It provides a synopsis of an interaction in an Austen novel that illustrates a literary concept discussed in the following sentence.

## ID: aa5897b8 Answer

Correct Answer: D

### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The underlined sentence provides a concrete example to ground readers' understanding of the "deep intersubjectivity" described in the next sentence as central to Austen's work.

Choice A is incorrect. There is no evaluation made of Austen's skill in this sentence, and no examples are given in the following sentence. This choice essentially flips the paragraph: it's this first sentence that provides an example. Choice B is incorrect. There are no other Austen protagonists mentioned in this passage, so this couldn't be the answer. Choice C is incorrect. The underlined sentence doesn't identify any "recurring theme" but instead simply describes one interaction from one book. This interaction exemplifies the literary technique of "deep intersubjectivity" that is introduced in the next sentence.

Mathematician Claude Shannon is widely regarded as a foundational figure in information theory. His most important paper, "A Mathematical Theory of Communication," published in 1948 when he was employed at Bell Labs, utilized a concept called a "binary digit" (shortened to "bit") to measure the amount of information in any signal and determine the fastest rate at which information could be transmitted while still being reliably decipherable. Robert Gallagher, one of Shannon's colleagues, said that the bit was "[Shannon's] discovery, and from it the whole communications revolution has sprung."

Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?

- A. It presents a theoretical concept, illustrates how the name of the concept has changed, and shows how the name has entered common usage.
- B. It introduces a respected researcher, describes an aspect of his work, and suggests why the work is historically significant.
- C. It names the company where an important mathematician worked, details the mathematician's career at the company, and provides an example of the recognition he received there.
- D. It mentions a paper, offers a summary of the paper's findings, and presents a researcher's commentary on the paper.

## ID: b4887dae Answer

Correct Answer: B

### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The text starts with a general statement that introduces Shannon, then describes a specific contribution from one of his papers, then provides a quote that illustrates just how important this contribution was.

Choice A is incorrect. This isn't the overall structure. The text only mentions very briefly, in parentheses, that "binary digit" was shortened to "bit." It doesn't go into detail about this name change, and it doesn't discuss any "common usage" of the name at all. Choice C is incorrect. This isn't the overall structure. Shannon's employment at Bell Labs is only mentioned once, very briefly: the text never goes into detail about his career there, and it never mentions any recognition he received there. Choice D is incorrect. This is too narrow. Overall, the text is about Shannon's importance in his field, not just this one paper of his.

According to Indian economist and sociologist Radhakamal Mukerjee (1889–1968), the Eurocentric concepts that informed early twentieth-century social scientific methods-for example, the idea that all social relations are reducible to struggles between individuals—had little relevance for India. Making the social sciences more responsive to Indians' needs, Mukerjee argued, required constructing analytical categories informed by India's cultural and ecological circumstances. Mukerjee thus proposed the communalist "Indian village" as the ideal model on which to base Indian economic and social policy.

Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?

- A. The text recounts Mukerjee's early training in the social scientific disciplines and then lists social policies whose implementation Mukerjee oversaw.
- B. The text mentions some of Mukerjee's economic theories and then traces their impact on other Indian social scientists of the twentieth century.
- C. The text presents Mukerjee's critique of the social sciences and then provides an example of his attempts to address issues he identified in his critique.
- D. The text explains an influential economic theory and then demonstrates how that theory was more important to Mukerjee's work than other social scientists have acknowledged.

## ID: 34d7bb25 Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The text does indeed present Mukerjee's critique of the social sciences-that they were too Eurocentric—and then provides an example of how he attempted to address the issues he identified: by suggesting a social science model based on the Indian village.

Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn't discuss Mukerjee's early training or his oversight of the implementation of social policies at all. Choice B is incorrect. The text never discusses any other Indian social scientists. Choice D is incorrect. The text never mentions other social scientists' responses to Mukerjee's work.

Space scientists Anna-Lisa Paul, Stephen M. Elardo, and Robert Ferl planted seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana in samples of lunar regolith—the surface material of the Moon—and, serving as a control group, in terrestrial soil. They found that while all the seeds germinated, the regolith-grown plants were stunted compared with those in the control group. Moreover, unlike the plants in the control grown plants exhibited red pigmentation, reduced leaf size, and inhibited growth rates—indicators of stress that were corroborated by postharvest molecular analysis.

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

- A. It describes an experiment that addressed an unresolved question about the extent to which lunar regolith resembles terrestrial soils.
- B. It compares two distinct methods of assessing indicators of stress in plants grown in a simulated lunar environment.
- C. It presents evidence in support of the hypothesis that seed germination in lunar habitats is an unattainable goal.
- D. It discusses the findings of a study that evaluated the effects of exposing a plant spil conditions.

### ID: 4eee64fa Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The text describes an experiment wherein space scientists compared plant growth in terrestrial and lunar soil conditions. It then discusses the findings of the study, including the fact that all the seeds germinated but that the plants grown in lunar soil exhibited signs of stress.

Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn't address this question, and never describes any specific characteristics of either soil. It merely describes the outcome of an experiment that exposed a plant species to lunar soil conditions. Choice B is incorrect. The text never compares methods of assessing indicators of stress—instead, it simply mentions several stress indicators observed in the study (red pigmentation, reduced leaf size, and inhibited growth rates). Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn't present any evidence that we could never achieve seed germination in lunar habitats, and in fact states that the seeds in the lunar soil did germinate.

Raymond Antrobus, an accomplished poet and writer of prose, recently released his debut spoken word poetry album, The First Time I Wore Hearing Aids, in collaboration with producer lan Brennan. The album contains both autobiographical and reflective pieces combining Antrobus's spoken words with Brennan's fragments and pieces of music to convey how people who are deaf may experience sound, both its presence and absence. Some critics suggest that the album questions the function of sound in the world, highlighting that the experience of sound is multifaceted.

Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?

- A. It introduces a collaborative spoken word poetry project, details the approach taken to produce the work, and then provides an example of critique the album received upon release.
- B. It mentions a collection of spoken word poems, distinguishes one poem as being an exemplar on the album, and then offers a summary of the subject matter of the whole collection.
- C. It summarizes the efforts to produce a collection of spoken word poems, presents biographies of two people who worked on the album, and speculates about the meaning behind the poetry.
- D. It connects two artists to the same spoken word poetry project, explains the extent of their collaboration on each poem, and then provides an overview of the technique used to produce the work.

## ID: a70cbc53 Answer

Correct Answer: A

### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The text first introduces the album as being a collaboration between Antrobus and Brennan, then describes the approach taken to produce it, then mentions have said that it calls into question the function of sound.

Choice B is incorrect. While the text does mention a collection of spoken word poems, it doesn't single out one poem as being particularly noteworthy. Additionally, the text doesn't simply summarize the subject matter—it goes into detail about the content and production of the album. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn't provide biographical information about the two artists, and the text doesn't speculate about the meaning behind the poetry—instead, it relays what some critics have said about the album. Choice D is incorrect.

The 1967 release of Harold Cruse's book The Negro Intellectual isolated him from almost all other scholars and activists of the American Civil Rights Movement—though many of those thinkers disagreed with each other, he nonetheless found ways to disagree with them all. He thought that activists who believed that Black people such as himself should culturally assimilate were naïve. But he also sharply criticized Black nationalists such as Marcus Garvey who wanted to establish independent, self-contained Black economies and societies, even though Cruse himself identified as a Black nationalist.

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?

A. It describes a direction that Cruse felt the Civil Rights Movement ought to take.

B. It indicates that Cruse's reputation as a persistent antagonist of other scholars is undeserved.

C. It describes a controversy that Cruse's work caused within the Black nationalist movement.

D. It helps explain Cruse's position with respect to the community of civil rights thinkers.

## ID: 9b01bcf4 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The text as a whole claims that Cruse disagreed with virtually all other Civil Rights scholars and activists. The underlined sentence describes one way that Cruse both did and didn't fit in with those thinkers: he criticized Black nationalists, even though he identified as one.

Choice A is incorrect. The underlined sentence doesn't do this. It describes Cruse's criticisms—it never mentions what Cruse did want the movement to do instead. Choice B is incorrect. This conflicts with the text, which argues that Cruse did disagree with almost all other scholars of the Civil Rights Movement. Choice C is incorrect. This is a step too far. The text never says that Cruse's work caused controversy within the Black nationalist movement.

Asteroid 6478 Gault has experienced intermittent mass loss since at least 2013, but in contrast to some other asteroids with repeated mass-loss episodes, 6478 Gault has not lost mass at its perihelion (the closest point of its orbit to the Sun), and thus the loss is not attributable to solar energy-driven ice vaporization. And as Jane X. Luu et al. point out, the singular nature of impact ejection makes it untenable as an account of multiple loss episodes of similar duration over several years. Instead, Luu et al. are likely correct that 6478 Gault is shedding mass due to rotational instability.

Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?

It presents a scientific observation, describes a contrast between that observation and other observations, and then A. explains why those other observations should not be considered credible.

It describes an astronomical finding, discusses competing theories about that the author regards as flawed, B. and then describes new evidence that supports an alternative theory.

It introduces a natural phenomenon, refutes two potential explanations for that phenomenon, and then presents a third C. explanation for that phenomenon that the author regards as plausible.

It discusses a physical process, evaluates possible causes of that process, and then states that a persuasive account of D. the process has yet to be put forward.

## ID: 6ae393f7 Answer

Correct Answer: C

{13}------------------------------------------------

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text begins by introducing the natural phenomenon of intermittent mass loss with regard to Asteroid 6478 Gault and notes that it curiously has not lost mass at its perihelion like other asteroids typically do. The text then refutes "solar energy-driven ice vaporization" and "the singular nature of impact ejection" as two possible explanations for Asteroid 6478 Gault's internittent mass loss. Finally, the text presents Luu et al.'s explanation that "6478 Gault is shedding mass due to rotational instability," which the author says is "likely correct." Thus, the text is that it introduces a natural phenomenon, refutes two potential explanations for that presents a third explanation for that phenomenon that the author regards as plausible.

Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't distinquish between multiple observations. It focuses on the single observation that Asteroid 6478 Gault is losing mass and evaluations for the phenomenon. The text also asserts that Luu et al.'s explanation is credible and "likely correct." Choice B is incorrect because the text describes a natural phenomenon, not a specific astronomical finding. In addition, although the text does note flawed reasons for Asteroid 6478 Gault's intermittent mass loss, it doesn't mention that Asteroid 6478 Gault's intermittent mass loss is based on new evidence. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text does evaluate explanations for the cause of Asteroid 6478 Gault's intermittent mass loss, the text also asserts that Luu et al.'s explanation that they have put forth is persuasive and "likely correct."

Historians have arqued that a crucial component of the Civil Rights Movement's success in the 1960s was the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's Citizen Education Program (CEP), which invited promising activists from across the South to its one-week training sessions in Dorchester, Georgia. Led by experienced organizers such as Dorothy Cotton and Septima Clark, CEP attendees—more than 7,000 in all—participated in workshops on topics ranging from public speaking to legal doctrine before returning home and using their newly acquired knowledge to spearhead local civil rights initiatives.

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?

A. It underscores the extent of the CEP's impact on the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.

- B. It illustrates the CEP organizers' efforts to educate participants on a wide variety of topics.
It suggests that CEP attendees held a diverse array of opinions about the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's C. political philosophy.

D. It establishes that criticism of the CEP was limited to a few individuals in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

## ID: 2e744883 Answer

#### Correct Answer: A

### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text states that the CEP had a positive impact on the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. The next sentence explains that the CEP orqanized workshops for attendees, who later used the knowledge they gained to lead civil rights initiatives. And the underlined portion indicates the number of activists-more than 7,000-who participated in the workshops. Thus, the underlined portion provides a number that underscores the extent of the CEP's impact on the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s.

Choice B is incorrect. Although the sentence that contains the underlined portion some CEP workshop topics, the underlined portion itself addresses the number of participants in the CEP workshops, not the number of topics covered.

In 2020, rap artist and professor A.D. Carson published the first peer-reviewed rap album about his experiences with Black masculinity called "i used to love to dream." Typically in peer review, experts evaluate scholarly articles prior to publication. For Carson's album, dubbed a "mixtap/e/ssay" peer review involved both scholars and rap artists. In combining elements of a mixtape album with scholarly essays that connect Carson's lyrics to historical and contemporary contexts for listeners both inside and outside academia, Carson's album helped redefine how scholarship is created and shared.

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

- A. To compare the relative public impact of scholarly articles and albums
- B. To capture one scholar's opinion of a new rap album
- C. To explain why a certain rap album is particularly innovative
- D. To describe how each step of the peer review process unfolds

### ID: d9915c15 Answer

#### Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it best describes the main purpose of the text, which is to explain why a certain rap album is particularly innovative. The text mentions rap artist and professor A.D. Carson, who published "the first peerreviewed rap album." The text also describes the unusual process of having the work evaluated by both scholars and rap artists before its release, and details how the album combines elements of a mixtape album with elements of scholarly essays. All of these characteristics of the album and the way in which it was developed help to demonstrate the album's novelty.

Choice A is incorrect because though the text mentions an album that combines elements of scholarly essays and mixtapes, it does not compare the relative public impact of scholarly articles and albums. Choice B is incorrect because the text does not present the opinion of a scholar reqarding the rap album. Choice D is incorrect because though the text mentions that the album was peer reviewed, it does not detail the steps of the review.
