Rejecting the premise that the literary magazine Ebony and Topaz (1927) should present a unified vision of Black American identity, editor Charles S. Johnson fostered his contributors' diverse perspectives by promoting their authorial autonomy. Johnson's self-effacement diverged from the editorial stances of W.E.B. Du Bois and Alain Locke, whose decisions for their publications were more

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. proficient
- B. dogmatic
- C. ambiguous
- D. unpretentious

### ID: 22a41819 Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. A person who is "dogmatic" believes strongly that their principles and opinions are true. Because Du Bois and Locke are implied to have one "unified vision" of Black American identity that they prioritize over the "diverse perspectives" of different writers, they can be described as dogmatic.

Choice A is incorrect. "Proficient" means "skilled." Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text suggests that Johnson was not skilled at making editorial decisions. Based on the text, the three editors just have different styles; they're not necessarily more or less skilled. Choice C is incorrect. "Ambiguous" means "unclear" or "open to multiple interpretations." However, it's actually Johnson who encouraged multiple interpretations ("diverse perspectives"). Since Du Bois and Locke are said to "diverge" from Johnson, we can assume that the views they published were not ambiguous, but instead clear and firm (a "unified vision"). Choice D is incorrect. "Unpretentious" means "not trying to impress others with greater skill or importance than is actually possessed." Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text suggests that Johnson is pretentious (trying to impress others).

Charities can mitigate this effect by compensating donors for nuisance costs, but those costs, though variable, are largely ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ likely favor attracting a few large donors over many small donors.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. supplemental to
- B. predictive of
- C. independent of
- D. subsumed in

#### ID: 5e57efec Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. We're told that charities that pay donors back for nuisance costs will attract a few large donors instead of many small donors. This suggests that nuisance costs are not linked to donation size.

Choice A is incorrect. This doesn't fit the logic of the text. If nuisance costs are supplemental to (meaning in addition to) donation size, that wouldn't result in charities that compensate donors for those costs attracting a few large donors over many small donors. Choice B is incorrect. This doesn't fit the logic of the text. If nuisance costs can predict donation size, that wouldn't necessarily result in charities that compensate donors for those costs attracting a few large donors over many small donors. Choice D is incorrect. This doesn't fit the logic of the text. If nuisance costs are subsumed in (meaning included in) donation size, that wouldn't result in charities that compensate donors for those costs attracting a few large donors over many small donors.

The following text is adapted from George Eliot's 1871–72 novel Middlemarch.

[Mr. Brooke] had travelled in his younger years, and was held in this part of the country to have contracted a too rambling habit of mind. Mr. Brooke's conclusions were as difficult to predict as the weather.

3.3

As used in the text, what does the word "contracted" most nearly mean?

- A. Restricted
- B. Described
- C. Developed
- D. Settled

#### ID: e459076b Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, "contracted" most nearly means developed. The text explains that Mr. Brooke has a "too rambling habit of mind," which the text likens to a disease, saying he is thought to have contracted it. To contract a disease means to acquire or develop a disease. In other words, the text indicates that Mr. Brooke is believed to have acquired, or developed, the habit of mind described in the text.

Choice A is incorrect. Although "contracted" can mean limited or restricted in some contexts, here Mr. Brooke is said to draw unpredictable conclusions, suqgesting that the "too rambling habit of mind," not that it has been somehow limited or restricted. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text describes Mr. Brooke's habit of mind, nothing suggests that those are his descriptions or, indeed, that he described his habit of mind at all. Choice D is incorrect because settled means calmed or mitigated, but here Mr. Brooke is said to draw unpredictable conclusions, suggesting that he exhibits this "too rambling habit of mind" not that it has been somehow calmed or mitigated.

The güiro, a musical instrument traditionally made from a dried and hollowed gourd, is thought to have originated with the Taíno people of Puers use a wooden stick to scrape along ridges cut into the side of the gourd, creating sounds that are highly ______ : the sounds produced by güiros can differ based on the distance between the ridges, the types of strokes the player uses, and the thickness of the gourd.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. overlooked
- B. powerful
- C. routine
- D. variable

### ID: 76e4c51d Answer

Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the sounds made by güiros. In this context, "variable" means able to change. The text begins by explaining that güiros are instruments made out of hollowed gourds with ridges cut into their sides and that players scrape the ridges with wooden sticks to produce sounds. The text goes on to say that quiros' sounds can change depending on gourd thickness, the distance between ridges, and the types of strokes the player uses, thus supporting the idea that the sounds created by these instruments are variable.

Choice A is incorrect because "overlooked" means not being seen or noticed, and there is nothing in the text to suggest that the sounds produced by güiros are overlooked or not noticed. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "powerful" would mean having a great ability to produce an effect. While it's possible that the sounds produced by güiros have a strong effect on listeners, the text doesn't discuss this aspect of their sounds. Choice C is incorrect because "routine" means usual and unvarying, and there is nothing in the text to suggest that the sounds produced by güiros are unvarying. In fact, the text describes how the sounds produced by güiros can differ based on several factors.

While scholars believe many Mesoamerican cities influenced each other, direct evidence is difficult to ascertain. However, recent excavations in a sector of Tikal (Guatemala) unearthed a citadel that shows Teotihuacán (Mexico) architecture—including a near replica of a famed Teotihuacán temple—providing tangible evidence of outside influence in portions of Tikal.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. refinements of
- B. precursors of
- C. commonalities with
- D. animosities toward

## ID: 54804e10 Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of architectural influences among Mesoamerican cities. In this context, "commonalities with" means similarities to or shared attributes with. The text indicates that a recently discovered citadel in Tikal includes a close imitation of a famous temple in Teotihuacán (another Mesoamerican city) and other evidence of Teotihuacán influence, which suggests that the citadel possesses features that resemble architectural features found in Teotihuacán. This context thus indicates that the Tikal citadel shows commonalities with Teotihuacán architecture.

Choice A is incorrect because there's nothing in the text that the Tikal citadel shows "refinements of," or improvements on, Teotihuacán architecture. Although the text suggests that the architecture of Teotihuacán influenced the architecture of the Tikal citadel, and although it's possible that later architectural designs could make improvements on earlier designs, the text doesn't discuss whether, in imitating Teotihuacán architecture, the Tikal citadel's builders improved on it. Choice B is incorrect because describing the citadel in Tikal as showinq "precursors of" Teotihuacán architecture-or features that preceded and foreshadowed those of Teotihuacán architecture=would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about the relationship between the architecture found in Tikal and Teotihuacán. The text claims that the discovery of similarities between the Tikal citadel and the architecture of Teotihuacán, including a replica of a temple in Teotihuacán, provides evidence of outside influences on Tikal architecture. If the Tikal citadel was influenced by Teotihuacán architecture, then the Teotihuacán architecture must predate the citadel, not the other way around. In this context, therefore, it wouldn't make sense to say that the Tikal citadel shows precursors of Teotihuacán architecture. Choice D is incorrect because the text discusses how the citadel in Tikal indicates the influence of Teotihuacán architecture, which implies that the makers of the Tikal citadel likely admired aspects of Teotihuacán architecture enough to imitate it. Thus, there's no

{5}------------------------------------------------

reason to think that the Tikal citadel provides evidence of the Tikal people's "animosities toward," or feelings of strong dislike or hostility toward, Teotihuacán architecture.

Close analysis of the painting Girl with a Flute, long attributed to the seventeenth-century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer, has revealed subtle deviations from the artist's signature techniques. These variations suggest that the work may be that of a student under Vermeer's tutelage-potentially _________ our understanding of Vermeer as a solitary artist.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. negating
- B. prefiguring
- C. entrenching
- D. substantiating

### ID: c14daa3c Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. "Neqating" means "reversing" or "making invalid." Proving that Vermeer worked with students would reverse the view of him as a solitary artist.

Choice B is incorrect. "Prefiguring" means "being an early indicator of." There already existed views of Vermeer as a solitary painter, so a new painting would not be an early indicator of those views. Rather, a painting proving that Vermeer had a student would contradict those earlier views. Choice C is incorrect. "Entrenching" means "olidifying." A painting proving that Vermeer had a student would not solidify views of him as solitary, but would rather contradict those views. Choice D is incorrect. "Substantiating" means "supporting with proof." A painting proving that Vermeer had a student would not support views of him as solitary, but would rather contradict those views.

While most animals are incapable of passing somatic mutations-genetic alterations that arise in an organism's nonreproductive cells-on to their offspring, elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata) presents an intriguing ________ in a 2022 study, researchers found that elkhorn coral produced offspring that inherited somatic mutations from a parent.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. hypothesis
- B. affinity
- C. anomaly
- D. corroboration

## ID: e4f312c5 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. An "anomaly" is something that deviates from norms or expectations. In this case, the elkhorn coral is an anomaly because it can pass on somatic mutations, whereas most other animals can't.

Choice A is incorrect. A "hypothesis" is "a theory about something," but no theories are provided about elkhorn coral in this text, just facts. Choice B is incorrect. "Affinity" represents "an inclination or liking toward something" As genetic mutations tend to occur without any conscious effort, you can't really have an inclination toward passing on somatic mutations. Choice D is incorrect. "Corroboration" means "evidence to support or prove something." Because elkhorn coral do the opposite of what most animals do, they do not provide corroboration of the theory that somatic mutations can't be passed onto offspring. Rather, they show the opposite.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. depleted
- B. homogeneous
- C. immature
- D. dispersed

## ID: 3d658a5a Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it most loqically completes the text's discussion of Jha and Kremen's finding about bees' foraging behavior. In this context, "homogeneous" means uniform or of the same kind. The text indicates that some models predict that the distance that bees travel when they're foraging declines as the density of flowers increases. The text goes on to say, however, that Jha and Kremen identified a circumstance in which bees don't behave this way. Specifically, if bees encounter "patches of low species richness"—that is, patches in which the flowers are largely from the same species-they'll travel beyond those patches to get varied food resources. This context thus suggests that bees don't behave as some models predict if the dense patches of flowers the bees encounter are homoqeneous.

Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave differently than some models predict if the bees encounter flower patches that are not rich in species, not if the flowers are "depleted," or emptied or reduced in quality or quantity. Although it could be true that bees are likely to leave depleted patches in search of more resources, the text doesn't indicate that Jha and Kremen investigated that possibility. Choice C is incorrect because there's no information in the text suqgesting that behave as some models predict if flowers in patches are "immature," or not fully developed. Instead, the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave contrary to some models' predictions if the flower patches are not rich in species. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that bees' behavior will be inconsistent with the predictions of some models if the flower patches that the bees encounter are of low species richness, not if the flowers are in patches that are "dispersed," or widely scattered. Although the text does describe bees as leaving patches that are not rich in species to forage elsewhere, there's no suggestion that Jha and Kremen found that the distance between dense flower patches affects whether the bees behave as some models predict.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. compliance with
- B. exposure to
- C. criteria for
- D. forfeiture of

# ID: 3f753a8e Answer

Correct Answer: B

### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. "Exposure to" means "having contact with." It makes sense that Prasad and Bainbridge were investigating whether seeing false versions of images was a cause of false visual memories. Notice how "exposure to incorrect renditions" matches the idea of "familiarity with erroneous versions" which appears later in the sentence.

Choice A is incorrect. "Compliance with" means "going along with a command or directive" False versions of images can't give commands or directives, so this doesn't apply. Choice C is incorrect. "Criteria" means "standards by which to judge something." It's not clear how people would come to have standards for the wronq version of an image in the first place, let alone how those standards would cause them to falsely remember the correct version. In other words, this choice would result in a confusing, unclear sentence. "Forfeiture of" means "a qiving up of something." It wouldn't make sense to say that false memories of an image might be caused by qivinq up the wrong version of the image.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. inevitable
- B. satisfactory
- C. negligible
- D. commonplace

# ID: e8fb0744 Answer

Correct Answer: C

### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the study of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples. In this context, "nealigible" means not significant enough to be worth considering. The text says that the study challenged the accepted view of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples. The text goes on to say that the researchers found that "in fact, as many as half" the hunters in the groups studied were female. The phrase "in fact" establishes a contrast indicating that the finding that as many as half the hunters were female differs from the accepted view. This context suggests, then, that the accepted view is that female participation in hunting was negligible.

Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half of hunters among prehistoric peoples were female, which suggests that the accepted view is that female participation was low, not that female participation was "inevitable," or unavoidable. Nothing in the text suqqests that the accepted view is that prehistoric peoples could not avoid female participation in hunting. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the accepted view of female participation in hunting amonq prehistoric peoples is that such participation was "satisfactory" or sufficient to meet a requirement or demand. There is no information in the text about any demands or requirements regarding female participation in hunting, let alone any information about how much female participation in hunting would be enough to satisfy those demands or requirements. Instead, the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half the hunters in the groups studied were female, suggesting that the accepted view is that female participation in hunting was low. Choice D is incorrect because that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half of hunters among the prehistoric peoples studied were female, which suggests that the accepted view is that female participation was low, not that female participation was "commonplace," or ordinary or unremarkable. Although the study under discussion suggests that female

The following text is from the 1989 novel The Ancient Child by Kiowa writer N. Scott Momaday. The main character has achieved tremendous commercial success as a painter.

More and more often he was asked to compromise his art or himself in one way or another, and more often than not he did so, for he was inclined to be passive and naive; it was difficult for him to say no. Those who exhibited his work, who praised and purchased it, and who demanded its proliferation began to determine it.

©1989 by N. Scott Momaday

As used in the text, what does the word "determine" most nearly mean?

- A. Conclude
- B. Dictate
- C. Evaluate
- D. Select

### ID: 9b22bf7b Answer

#### Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text "determine" most nearly means "dictate" The text describes the relationship between the main character and those who exhibit, praise, and purchase his artwork. The text states that the main character is often asked to change his art or himself based on outside influences, and he usually acquiesces. Because the main character admits that those who support his work often shape it follows that those outside influences dictate, or quide or dominate, the direction his work takes.

Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that outside influences "conclude" or end, the main character's work. The text states that many supporters of the main character's art "demand its proliferation" not its conclusion. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that outside influences are "evaluating" or judging the main character's work. According to the text, the main character's art has already achieved great commercial success, with many people exhibiting, purchasing, and praising his work. Thus, outsiders have already supported the main character's work and are not questioning or evaluating its success or worth. They are instead influencing its initial direction. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that outside influences "select," or choose the main character's work. According to the text, the main character's art has already achieved great commercial success, with many people exhibiting, purchasing, his work. Thus, outsiders have already supported the main character's work and are not selecting it. They are instead influencing its initial direction.
