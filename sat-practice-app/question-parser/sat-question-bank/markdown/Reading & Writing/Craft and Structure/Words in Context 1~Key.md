The following text is from Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula. The narrator is being driven in a carriage through a remote region at night.

The baying of the wolves sounded nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.

As used in the text, what does the word "disturbed" most nearly mean?

- A. Disorganized
B. Alarmed

- C. Offended
- D. Interrupted

ID: 45a109a3 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, "disturbed" most nearly means alarmed. The text portrays the narrator traveling in a carriage as wolves howl in the surrounding darkness. The text contrasts the reaction of both the narrator and the horses pulling the carriage with that of the cariage the narrator and horses are "dreadfully afraid," but the driver is "not in the least disturbed." In other words, the driver is not alarmed by the wolves nearby.

Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, "disturbed" can mean disorganized, the text doesn't portray a character acting in a disorganized manner; instead, the driver continues to drive the carriage, even though the horses pulling it are alarmed. Choice C is incorrect. Although in some contexts, "disturbed" can mean offended, the text doesn't portray one character feeling offended, or upset, by another's actions; instead, it contrasts the fear felt by the narrator with another's lack of fear. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts, "disturbed" can mean interrupted, the text doesn't portray an action being interrupted, indeed, the travel depicted in the scene continues despite the threat of the wolves outside the carriage.

Dance choreographer Jawole Willa Jo Zollar aims to give people the opportunity to be _______ her creative process. For example, live performances of her dance HairStories, which debuted in 2001, featured videos of people across the United States talking about their hair and audience members sharing pictures of their interesting hairstyles.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. nervous about
- B. completed by
- C. delayed by
- D. involved in

#### ID: d4a8f7cb Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. "Involved in" means "playing an active role in." This fits the context clues describing how Zollar includes the audience in her shows by incorporating their stories and pictures.

Choice A is incorrect. "Nervous" means "worried or anxious about." Nothing in the text suggests that people would be nervous about Zollar's creative process. Choice B is incorrect. "Completed by" means "made whole by." It doesn't make sense to say that Zollar's shows would make her audience complete. Choice C is incorrect. "Delayed by" means "made late by." Nothing in the text suggests that people would be delayed by Zollar's creative process.

A musician and member of the Quechua of Peru, Renata Flores Rivera was eager to promote the Quechua language in her music, but she was ________ speaking it. She met this challenge by asking her grandmother, a native speaker of Quechua, to help her pronounce words in her song lyrics and also by taking classes in the language.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. prepared for
- B. inexperienced with
- C. skilled in
- D. excited about

#### ID: 06b96bfc Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Renata Flores Rivera's use of Quechua in her music. In this context, "inexperienced with" means not accustomed to. The text indicates that Flores Rivera wanted to promote the Quechua language in her music and overcame a challenge by seeking help with pronunciation from her grandmother and by taking language classes. This context conveys the idea that Flores Rivera was not sufficiently familiar with Quechua to use it in her music without help. Thus, she was inexperienced with speaking the language, which she addressed by seeking help.

Choice A is incorrect because describing Flores Rivera as "prepared for"-or ready for-speaking Quechua wouldn't make sense in context. The text indicates that speaking Quechua presented a challenge, but if she were ready to speak the language, then there would be no challenge. Choice C is incorrect because describing Flores Rivera as "skilled in"—meaning good at or capable of—speaking Quechua wouldn't make sense in context. The text indicates that speaking Quechua presented a challenge, but if she were capable of speaking the language, then there would be no challenge. Choice D is incorrect. Flores Rivera was likely "excited about" -or thrilled or delighted with -speaking Quechua, but this wouldn't make sense in context. The text indicates that speaking Quechua presented a challenge, but if she were delighted with speaking the language, then there would be no challenge.

The following text is from Yann Martel's 2001 novel Life of Pi. The narrator's family owned a zoo when he was a child.

It was a huge zoo, spread over numberless acres, big enough to require a train to explore it, though it seemed to get smaller as I grew older, train included.

©2001 by Yann Martel

1.4

As used in the text, what does the word "spread" most nearly mean?

A. Hidden

B. Discussed

- C. Extended
- D. Coated

#### ID: Of040c50 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, "spread" most nearly means extended. The text states that the zoo is "huqe" that it covers "numberless acres," and that it is large enough that a train is needed to explore it. Thus, the text's emphasis on the zoo's size suggests that the zoo extended, or stretched, over a large area of land.

Choice A is incorrect because if the zoo covers "numberless acres" then it could not reasonably be described as hidden, or concealed from view. Choice B is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that the zoo was discussed, or talked about. Rather, the text focuses on the zoo's large size. Choice D is incorrect. Althouqh in some contexts "spread" can mean coated, it doesn't have that meaning in this context because to coat something means to apply a thin layer of a liquid substance, such as oil or paint, to a surface. Therefore, it would not be accurate to say that the zoo coated the acres on which it sits.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. replacing
- B. inventing
- C. preserving
- D. counting

#### ID: 9cdcd902 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. "Preserving" means "maintaining" or "keeping in good condition," so preserving the photographs means that audiences should be able to view them for a long time.

Choice A is incorrect. "Replacing" means "putting something new in place of" the photographs. Replacing the photos will make it so that audiences can't view them at all. Choice B is incorrect. "Inventing" means "creating a new idea, process, or thing." The museum can't invent photographs that already exist. Choice D is incorrect. Counting the photographs will not help audiences view them well into the future.

In the 1970s, video cameras became increasingly affordable for ordinary consumers and gave Ulysses Jenkins and other artists capabilities that were previously unavailable except to television broadcasters. Jenkins recognized and took full advantage of this __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ of video art, such as Mass of Images (1978).

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. newfound
- B. delicate
- C. inevitable
- D. habitual

#### ID: e3f05561 Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Ulysses Jenkins's video art. As used in this context, "newfound" means recently discovered or established. The text indicates that in the 1970s, video cameras became cheaper and therefore more widely available than they had been in the past. The text goes on to say that this development provided Jenkins and other artists with capabilities that they previously didn't have. As a result, Jenkins began producing groundbreaking works of video art. This context supports the idea that Jenkins took advantage of newfound access to video cameras.

Choice B is incorrect because "delicate" means fine in texture or easily broken, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text doesn't focus on describing what video art looks like or whether it's breakable. Choice C is incorrect because "inevitable" means impossible to avoid, which wouldn't make sense in this context. The text doesn't discuss the likelihood of artists, or anyone else, gaining access to video cameras. Choice D is incorrect because "habitual" means doing something reqularly or repeatedly. Although the text does suggest that Jenkins created multiple pieces of video art, its focus is on the fact that video cameras had only just become widely available to artists in the 1970s. Jenkins's ability to take advantage of video cameras to make art was therefore newfound, not habitual, at the time.

A brief book review cannot fully convey the __________ of Olga Tokarczuk's novel The Books of Jacob, with its enormous cast of characters, its complicated, wandering plot, and its page numbers that count backward (beginning at 965 and ending at 1).

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. accuracy
- B. inactivity
- C. complexity
- D. restraint

#### ID: 4a2b2535 Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Olga Tokarczuk's novel The Books of Jacob. As used in this context, "complexity" means having many complicated parts that when taken as a whole are difficult to follow or explain. The Books of Jacob has a large cast of characters, a complicated and wandering plot (that is, a plot that is difficult to follow), and reverse page numbering. Toqether, these features make up a novel that's challenging to read and summarize. This context supports the idea that a brief book review can't do justice to the novel's complexity.

Choice A is incorrect. Although the word "accuracy" or being free from error or falsehood, can sometimes be used to describe a novel, the text doesn't discuss whether Tokarczuk's novel has this quality. Instead, the text describes the novel as having a large cast of characters, a difficult-to-follow plot, and reverse page numbering. These features suggest complexity, not accuracy. Choice B is incorrect because "inactivity" means being in a state of idleness or doing nothing, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text describes Tokarczuk's novel, and although it's possible the novel could portray its characters as inactive, it wouldn't make sense to describe the novel itself as such. Choice D is incorrect because in this context "restraint" would mean holding back or showing self-control, and the text doesn't indicate that Tokarczuk's novel has either of these qualities. In fact, the features of the novel that the text describes, such as a large cast of characters, a complicated and wandering plot, and reverse page numbering, suggest excess and complexity, not restraint.

The following text is from Nella Larsen's 1928 novel Quicksand.

The trees in their spring beauty sent through her restive mind a sharp thrill of pleasure. Seductive, charming, and beckoning as cities were, they had not this easy unhuman loveliness.

As used in the text, what does the word "beckoning" most nearly mean?

- A. Demanding
- B. Signaling
- C. Inviting
- D. Shifting

### ID: 9ccf463e Answer

Correct Answer: C

### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, "beckoning" most nearly means "inviting" or attractive. The text portrays a woman who is looking at "trees in their spring beauty" She compares them to cities, which have their own pleasures even if they do not have the "easy unhuman loveliness" of trees: she thinks of cities as "seductive" and "charming" both adjectives that signify something that is enticing, or attractive. Therefore, cities that are seductive and charming would also be described as inviting people closer to them.

Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication in this context that cities are "demanding" or requiring effort. Choice B is incorrect. Though "signaling," or communicating something, might be considered a key feature of the act of "beckoning" in the context here, "beckoning" suggests that cities have attractive qualities that naturally draw people to them. Such attractive qualities are not described by the word "signaling" alone. Therefore, "signaling" is an incorrect answer because it is insufficiently precise. Choice D is incorrect because there is no reason to think in this context that the cities are "shifting," or changing shape.

Biologist Jane Edgeloe and colleagues have located what is believed to be the largest individual plant in the world in the Shark Bay area of Australia. The plant is a type of seagrass called Posidonia australis, and it . approximately 200 square kilometers.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. acknowledges
- B. produces
- C. spans
- D. advances

### ID: ca47273b Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. "Spans" means "extends over a distance of" or "encompasses." Since we're talking about the world's largest plant, it makes sense to say that it "spans" about 200 square kilometers.

Choice A is incorrect. "Acknowledges" means "recognizes" or "admits the truth of." Either way, it doesn't make sense here: a plant can't "acknowledge" a distance. Choice B is incorrect. "Produces" can mean "makes," "causes," or "presents." But none of those definitions make sense here: a plant can't make, cause, or present a distance. Choice D is incorrect. This doesn't fit the logic of the text. "Advances" means "moves forward" or "progresses." But the plant isn't necessarily moving forward. Rather, the text suggests that it already covers a distance of 200 square kilometers.

Bioluminescent beetles called fireflies may seem to create flashes of light randomly, but each species of firefly actually has its own special series of repeated flashes and pauses. These unique ____________________________________________________________________________________________ same species to find each other.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. quantities
- B. decorations
- C. patterns
- D. agreements

### ID: f3fac04f Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it most loqically completes the text's discussion of the flashes created by fireflies. In this context, "patterns" means distinct and predictable sequences. The text indicates that although the flashes that fireflies produce appear to occur randomly—that is, without any particular sequence or rhythm —each species actually produces its own special series of flashes and pauses. Indeed, these series of flashes are so unique that fireflies can use them to find other members of their species. Therefore, this context supports the idea that fireflies produce flashes in distinct and recognizable patterns.

Choice A is incorrect because "quantities" means certain amounts or numbers of something. Although the text discusses how different firefly species produce flashes and pauses in unique sequences that help other members of their species to find them, it doesn't mention the number of flashes that are used in these sequences. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "decorations" would mean things that make an object more beautiful. Although it may be reasonable to say that firefly flashes are beautiful, the text focuses on the fact that fireflies use these unique sequences of flashes to find other members of their own species, not that the flashes make fireflies more beautiful. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "agreements" would refer to deals that individuals have discussed and come to a consensus about. Since fireflies aren't capable of making such agreements, it wouldn't make sense to use this word to refer to the signals they send each other with their flashes.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. vivid
- B. unknown
- C. definite
- D. reserved

#### ID: a2835734 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. "Vivid" can mean "colorful" or "bright-colored." This definition fits the context clues about Alemán's fascination with and passion for bold colors.

Choice B is incorrect. This doesn't fit the logic of the text. Nothing in the text indicates that Alemán's artworks are "unknown." Choice C is incorrect. This doesn't fit the loqic of the text. "Definite" means "certain" or "decided." It wouldn't make sense to describe artwork as "definite." Choice D is incorrect. This doesn't fit the logic of the text. "Reserved" can either mean "slow to reveal emotions" or "booked." But the clues suggest that Alemán's artworks are boldly colorful—almost the opposite of "reserved."

The Appalachian Trail is a hiking path in the eastern United States. Much of the 2,000 mile trail passes through wilderness areas. In order to 1968, ensuring that the trail would not be sold or commercially developed.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. borrow
- B. postpone
- C. protect
- D. decorate

### ID: 637d0878 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. "Protect" means "preserve" or "keep safe from." By ensuring that the wilderness areas along the Appalachian Trail can't be sold or developed, the National Trails System Act protects them.

Choice A is incorrect. "Borrow" means "to take something with intent to return it." The text doesn't say anything about taking and returning the wilderness that surrounds the Appalachian Trail. Choice B is incorrect. "Postpone" means "to put off until later." Nothing in the passage suqqests that Congress wants to "postpone" the wilderness areas (and that doesn't make sense anyway—they can postpone doing something to the wilderness areas, but they can't postpone the areas themselves). Choice D is incorrect. "Decorate" means "to adorn" or "add extra items or pictures to make more attractive." No details in the text suggest that Congress wishes to make the trail fancier or more attractive.

The following text is adapted from Sui Sin Far's 1912 short story "Mrs. Spring Fragrance." Mr. and Mrs. Spring Fragrance immigrated to the United States from China.

Mrs. Spring Fragrance was unaware that Mr. Spring Fragrance, tired with the day's business, had thrown himself down on the bamboo settee on the veranda, and that although his eyes were engaged in scanning the pages of the Chinese World, his ears could not help receiving the words which were borne to him through the open window.

As used in the text, what does the word "receiving" most nearly mean?

- A. Denying
- B. Entering
- C. Carrying
- D. Hearing

### ID: 4480fae9 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, "receiving" most nearly means hearing, or perceiving sound. The text describes Mr. Spring Fragrance as he reads a newspaper, focusing on his eyes and ears. While his eyes look at the newspaper, he is unwillingly distracted by words coming through a nearby open window (that is, "his ears could not help receiving the words are being perceived specifically by his ears and not his eyes, and ears are the organs of sense with which one hears, so therefore Mr. Spring Fragrance is hearing the words through the open window.

Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication in the text that Mr. Spring Fragrance is denying, or refusing the truth of, the words coming to him through the window. He is merely distracted by them. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense to say that Mr. Spring Fragrance's ears couldn't help entering, or coming into, the words coming to him through the window. Instead, the text indicates that the opposite occurs: that is, when Mr. Spring Fragrance hears the words, they enter his ears, but his ears don't enter the words. Choice C is incorrect because it doesn't make sense in this context to think of Mr. Spring Fragrance as carrying the words coming to him through the window, even though the word "carry" can have a number of different meanings depending on context: for example, he is not lifting them, he is not supporting them, and he is not accepting blame for them (as one "carries the blame" for a mistake).

The company further solidified its ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Louisiana to Southern California, the route established the first transcontinental rail line across the southern United States.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. dominance
- B. creativity
- C. insignificance
- D. neutrality

### ID: afd48140 Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text's discussion of the Southern Pacific Railroad. As used in this context, "dominance" means the state of being more successful than others. The text states that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California's railways in 1877, and that the Sunset Route it constructed in 1883 was the first transcontinental rail line across the southern United States. Therefore, the Southern Pacific Railroad would be more successful than other railroads in the area, and the construction of the Sunset Route would further solidify its dominance in rail access to California's coast.

Choice B is incorrect. Although the construction of the Sunset Route must have required some creativity, or use of imagination, the word "creativity" would not also encompass the fact that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California's railways. The text is more focused on the railroad's control of the field and overall success rather than its imaginative thought processes. Choice C is incorrect because if the Southern Pacific Railroad controlled the majority of California's railways, it would not make sense to refer to its "insignificance," or the state of being unimportant. Rather, the opposite would be true. Choice D is incorrect because in context it would not make sense to refer to the Southern Pacific Railroad's "neutrality," or absence of strong opinion on a matter, since no opinions are mentioned. Nor would "neutrality" in the sense of impartiality in a conflict be a logical or precise choice since no conflict is explicitly described. There might be an implied conflict between the Southern Pacific Railroad and other railroads doing business in California, but that is not a conflict in which the Southern Pacific Railroad would take an impartial position.

Cucurbits, a group of plants that includes squash and melons, relied on mastodons to spread their seeds in the Ice Age. When these animals died out, cucurbits faced extinction in turn, having lost their means of seed dispersal. Around this time, however, the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America began raising cucurbits as crops, thus ____________ the plants' survival.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. verifying
- B. multiplying
- C. comforting
- D. ensuring

### ID: bdab32fc Answer

Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer because it most loqically completes the text's discussion of cucurbits. In this context, "ensuring" means quaranteeing, or making sure of, the cucurbits' survival. The text states that cucurbits faced extinction in the past because their means of seed dispersal disappeared, but the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America began farming cucurbits around that same time, so the crops were no longer threatened. Therefore, the context supports the idea that the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America helped with ensuring the cucurbits' survival.

Choice A is incorrect because in this context verifying means making sure that something is accurate. In the text, the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America were ensuring the survival, not the accuracy of, the cucurbits. Choice B is incorrect. Although the cucurbit crops themselves were multiplying, or growing in number, as a result of the work of the ancestors of Indiqenous peoples in North America, it wouldn't make sense in context to say that the survival of the plants was multiplying. Choice C is incorrect because according to the text, in raising cucurbits as crops, the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America were attempting to help the plants grow and survive; they weren't attempting to comfort, or free the plants from pain.

According to statistician Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the best way to predict the amount of time a nonperishable entity (such as a building or a technology) will continue to exist is to examine how long it has survived so far. In this view, an item's age is the strongest _________ how much longer it will last.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. uncertainty about
- B. indicator of
- C. motivation for
- D. criticism of

### ID: b92c13fa Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. "Indicator" means "something that shows or suggests," which matches Taleb's argument that an item's age can suggest how much longer it will last.

Choice A is incorrect. The passage tells us that examining an item's age is the best way to predict how much longer it will last. Therefore, according to Taleb's theory, an item's age should add more certainty about how much longer it will last. Choice C is incorrect. A "motivation" is "a reason for doing." Items don't have feelings and motivations, so it wouldn't make sense to say that their age is a motivation for how much longer they will last. Choice D is incorrect. "Criticism" can mean "describing faults or problems" or "an analysis of an artistic work" Neither of these definitions makes sense here. An item's age can't criticize how much longer it will last.

In the mid-nineteenth century, some abolitionist newspapers _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ printing a letter that described the easy fortunes and high salaries miners could make in California during the Gold Rush, Frederick Douglass's newspaper North Star was one such publication that inspired readers to relocate.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. stimulated
- B. assigned
- C. opposed
- D. disregarded

### ID: 849bf8d7 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. "Stimulated" means "encouraged interest or increased activity in." Because the newspapers discussed the benefits of westward migration and "inspired readers to relocate," we can infer that they encouraged people to move west.

Choice B is incorrect. "Assigned" means "gave a job or duty" Newspapers do not have the power to assign people to move west, although they can encourage it. Choice C is incorrect. "Opposed" means "disapproved of." We can tell that this isn't the case, because the newspapers discussed "the easy fortunes and high salaries miners could make in California" and "inspired readers to relocate." Choice D is incorrect. "Disregarded" means "ignored." If the newspapers are writing about the west and "inspir[ing] readers to relocate," they can't be ignoring it at the same time.

The following text is from Claude McKay's 1922 poem "Morning Jov." The speaker is looking out a window and observing a wold, or large area of land.

At night the wide and level stretch of wold, Which at high noon had basked in quiet gold, Far as the eye could see was ghostly white; Dark was the night save for the snow's weird light.

I drew the shades far down, crept into bed; Hearing the cold wind moaning overhead Through the sad pines, my soul, catching its pain, Went sorrowing with it across the plain.

As used in the text, what does the word "drew" most nearly mean?

- A. Pulled
- B. Drained
- C. Inspired
- D. Sketched

## ID: 9671d61d Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "drew" means pulled. In the text, the speaker stands at a window, looking out on a landscape at night. The speaker then "drew the shades far down, crept into bed." That is, the speaker pulled down, or lowered, the shades until they were completely shut before going to sleep.

Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, "drew" can refer to draining or removing liquid, especially water, as when someone draws water from a well, in this context it refers to the speaker pulling down window shades for the night. Choice C is incorrect. In some contexts, "drew" can be used to describe how a person or thinq inspires, or elicits, a response from someone, as when a performer draws applause from an audience. But in this context it refers to the speaker pulling down window shades for the night. Choice D is incorrect. Although "drew" has several meanings, including sketched, or illustrated with a pen or pencil, in this context it refers to the speaker pulling down window shades for the night.

Osage Nation citizen Randy Tinker-Smith produced and directed the ballet Wahzhazhe, which vividly chronicles Osage history and culture. Telling Osage stories through ballet is ______ choice because two of the foremost ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage: sisters Maria and Marjorie Tallchief.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. a suitable
- B. a determined
- C. an arbitrary
- D. an unpredictable

## ID: 9d73c9eb Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. "Suitable" means "appropriate for a particular purpose." Since the text indicates that two of the best ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage, we can infer that the author believes that ballet is a very suitable artform for telling Osage stories.

Choice B is incorrect. The text never suggests that Tinker-Smith's choice was determined. That would imply that Tinker-Smith initially faced some kind of obstacle or opposition, and nothing like that is mentioned in the passage. Choice C is incorrect. The text implies the opposite of this. "Arbitrary" means "based on random choice or whim rather than reason." But the text does give us a good reason behind the choice to tell Osage stories through ballet: two of the best ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage. Choice D is incorrect. The text never suggests that Tinker-Smith's choice was "unpredictable" Rather, the fact that two of the best ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage makes ballet especially appropriate for telling Osage stories.

The printing of Virqinia Woolf's novels featured a creative _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ painter, Bell worked closely with Woolf to create original cover art for most of the novels.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. rebellion
- B. partnership
- C. discovery
- D. disagreement

### ID: 8d579825 Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the cover art of Virginia Woolf's novels. In this context, "partnership" means collaboration or joint effort. The text states that Woolf's sister Vanessa Bell was a talented painter and that Bell worked with Woolf to provide the cover art for most of Woolf's novels. Thus, this context suqgests that Woolf and Bell pursued a creative partnership in order to produce several of Woolf's novels.

Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication that Woolf or Bell were underqoing a "rebellion" or revolt, against anything in particular. Instead, the text focuses on how they worked together in some aspects of the production of Woolf's novels. Choice C is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that Woolf or Bell made a "discovery" or encountered anything new for the first time as they worked together. The text suggests that Woolf had already written her novels and that Bell then assisted Woolf with the cover art for many of them. Choice D is incorrect because the text implies that Woolf and Bell had a positive relationship. According to the text, the sisters "worked closely" together to produce the cover art for many of Woolf's novels; the text doesn't mention whether while working together, Woolf and Bell had a "disagreement," or conflict.

Sumerian civilization (which lasted from around 3300 to 2000 BCE) day civilizations: for example, the first description of the seven-day week appears in the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. transformed
- B. introduced
- C. inherited
- D. overlooked

### ID: 47955354 Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the contributions of the Sumerian civilization. In this context, "introduced" means brought into practice or use. The first reference to a seven-day week appears in the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh. The text presents this information about the seven-day week as an example of a concept introduced by the Sumerian civilization that persists into presentday civilizations.

Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the Sumerian civilization "transformed," or changed the nature of, concepts that persist into present-day civilizations. Instead, the text's presentation of a Sumerian literary work that contains the first description of the seven-day week is an example of the phenomenon described in the first half of the sentence, suggesting that the Sumerians invented many concepts that still persist. Choice C is incorrect because the information that a Sumerian literary work includes the first description of the seven-day week suqgests that Sumerian civilization may have originated the seven-day week and other concepts that persist into present-day civilizations, not that it "inherited" the concepts, or received them from an ancestral figure or culture. Choice D is incorrect because the information that Sumerian civilization produced the first description of the seven-day week is presented as an example of the phenomenon described in the first half of the sentence, suggesting that Sumerian civilization originated this and other concepts that still persist, not that the Sumerians "overlooked," or failed to notice or consider, such concepts.

Physicist Joseph Weber performed experiments that scientists later used as the basis for their own investigations that led to the first verified detection of a gravitational wave in 2015.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. foundational
- B. supplementary
- C. repetitive
- D. ineffective

## ID: a3761c7e Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of physicist Joseph Webster's research on gravitational waves. In this context "foundational" means the basis on which something else develops. The text indicates that Webster's experiments in the 1960s and 1970s were earlier than, and "Rey" to, the work of later scientists in the field; thus, Webster's work was foundational to the later scientists and the eventual detection of a gravitational wave in 2015.

Choice B is incorrect because the text does not suggest that Webster's work was supplementary, or an additional element of an existing, larger project, but rather it was "the basis for" later experiments. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not assert that Webster's work was repetitive, or involved doing something the same way many times. Rather, the text indicates that Webster's work formed the basis for later investigations in the field of gravitational wave research. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not state that Webster's work was ineffective, or failed to produce the desired outcome. Rather, the text strongly implies that Webster's work was productive and extremely important to later work in the field of gravitational wave research.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

A. creative

B. bold

C. traditional

D. understandable

#### ID: 80ebb189 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it most loqically completes the text's discussion of Helen Liu Fond's architectural designs. In this context, "traditional" means conventional. The text states than use "standard shapes and colors" Fonq pursued "innovative" and "daring" design choices in her work. Fong's style is depicted as inventive, so it therefore makes sense in this context that she avoided mainstream, traditional designs in her buildings.

Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Fong's work is innovative and experimental. Thus, Fond's design choices could reasonably be considered creative, or original. She likely would have pursued creative designs, not avoided them. Choice B is incorrect because that Fong used "daring" hues in her designs. Thus, Fong likely would have pursued bold, or brave and vivid design choices; she wouldn't have avoided them. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't address whether Fong's designs are understandable, or reasonable or expected. The text focuses on certain characteristics of Fong's designs, not on how people received or understood them.

Sueño de Familia is an exhibition of drawings, paintings, and ceramics that explores the artistic heritage of US-based artist Yolanda González. The exhibition _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ grandmother, mother, and niece as well as González herself.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. borrows
- B. spans
- C. judges
- D. neglects

#### ID: b0ea8c28 Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the Sueño de Familia art exhibition. In this context, "spans" means extends across or covers. The text states that the exhibition explores González's artistic heritage and features artwork by her great-grandfather, grandmother, mother, and niece. This context conveys the idea that the exhibition spans, or extends across, five generations of González's family.

Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense to say that the exhibition "borrows" or acquires, five generations of González's family. The text indicates that the exhibition features artwork by family members from five generations, not that the five generations themselves have been acquired for inclusion in the exhibition. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that the purpose of the exhibition is to highlight artwork, not to "judge" or qive an opinion on, five generations of the artist's family. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that the exhibition "neglects," or qives little attention to, five generations of González's family. On the contrary, the text indicates that the exhibition is dedicated to exploring González's artistic heritage and therefore designed to bring attention to her family members and their artwork.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

A. avoided

B. featured

C. appreciated

D. disregarded

### ID: 0d402146 Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it most loqically completes the text's discussion of traffic signals. As used in this context, "featured" means had as a characteristic or part. The text indicates that althouqh US traffic signals have lights of three different colors (red, yellow, and green), this wasn't the 1920s, when the three-light signal was first developed. Before then, the text suggests, traffic signals had fewer lights (as indicated by the word "only" in the second sentence). This context supports the idea that before the 1920s, traffic signals featured only red and green lights.

Choice A is incorrect because "woided" means kept away from someone or something or prevented something from occurring, neither of which would make sense in context. The text doesn't discuss keeping away from someone or something but instead focuses on what US traffic signals look like. The text states that they didn't have lights of three different colors until the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. Choice C is incorrect because "appreciated" means admired or increased in value, neither of which would make sense in context. The text focuses solely on the fact that US traffic signals have contained lights of three colors only since the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. The text doesn't mention how this characteristic or traffic signals in general are perceived or what their value is. Moreover, the blank portion of the text describes "traffic signals" which are lifeless objects and therefore unable to admire or increase the value of something. Choice D is incorrect because "disregarded" means iqnored or treated something as unworthy of notice, neither of which would make sense in context. The text doesn't discuss how people react to traffic signals; rather, it addresses the idea that US traffic signals have contained lights of three colors only since the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. Moreover, the blank portion of the text describes "traffic signals" which are lifeless objects and therefore unable to ignore or treat something in a particular manner.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. pretending
- B. complaining
- C. requiring
- D. demonstrating

## ID: a4f50d30 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. "Demonstrating" means "showing" and the text describes how de Santana disproved a previous belief in only one species of electric eel by showing that three electric eel species actually exist.

Choice A is incorrect. Pretending that there are three species of electric eel might be a fun game for marine biologists, but it wouldn't prove the existence of more than one species. Choice B is incorrect. Complaining won't prove anything about eels, so de Santana could not have proved wrong the idea of only one species of electric eel by complaining about it. Choice C is incorrect. "Requiring" means "needing." It wouldn't make sense to say that de Santana "needed" there to be three distinct species of electric eel.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. secretive
- B. efficient
- C. outgoing
- D. unsympathetic

## ID: fa7a89f1 Answer

Correct Answer: B

### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it most loqically completes the text's discussion about Kouchaki and colleagues' research into how workload affects productivity. In context, "efficient" means effective or well orqanized. The text indicates that, according to Kouchaki and colleagues' research, people who worked on hard tasks first were "more skilled and productive" than those who did easy tasks first. This context conveys the idea that despite their sense of accomplishment, the people who chose to do the easy tasks first were less efficient or productive than those who tackled hard tasks first.

Choice A is incorrect because there's nothing in the text to suggest that workers who do easy tasks first are less "secretive," or uncommunicative or silent, than those who do hard tasks first. Rather, the text suggests that people are less skillful or efficient if they tackle easy tasks before the hard ones. Choice C is incorrect because "butgoing" means openly friendly, which wouldn't make sense in this context. The text focuses on Kouchaki and colleagues' research in which people who worked on hard tasks first were "more skilled and productive" than those who did easy tasks first and were therefore less efficient. Choice D is incorrect because there's nothing in the text to suggest that workers who do easy tasks first are less "unsympathetic," or insensitive or unkind, than those who do hard tasks first. Rather, the text suggests that people are less skillful or efficient if they tackle easy tasks before the hard ones.

Choice D is the best answer because it most loqically completes the text's discussion of Arturo A. Schomburg's collection. In this context, the phrase "depended on. The text explains that Schomburg, wanting to preserve "books, art, and other materials" created by peoples of African descent from around the world, built a large collection of these objects. The text also states that in order to obtain these items, Schomburg asked friends and colleagues who were traveling internationally to bring them back for him. This implies that he wouldn't have been able to create his collection without help. Thus, the context supports the idea that Schomburg relied on, or depended on, friends and colleaques to build his collection.

Choice A is incorrect because "admired" means respected and approved of. Although it's reasonable to expect that Schomburg respected his friends and colleagues, the text doesn't discuss any such aspect of their relationships. The text focuses instead on what Schomburg asked his friends and colleagues to do to help build his collection. Choice B is incorrect because "disaqreed with" means held an opposing belief, and nothing in the text suggests that Schomburg and his friends or colleagues held opposing views on any subject. In fact, the text strongly implies that Schomburg's friends and colleagues supported him in his goal of preserving objects of importance for Black history and culture by bringing him such objects from around the world. Choice C is incorrect because "warned" means informed someone in advance about something dangerous, which wouldn't make sense in this context. Nothing in the text suggests that Schomburg thought his friends and colleagues were in any danger, let alone that he warned them of danger.

The following text is adapted from Mohsin Hamid's 2017 novel Exit West. Saeed lives with his mother and father. On cloudless nights after a daytime rain, Saeed's father would sometimes bring out the family would sip green tea on their balcony, enjoying a breeze, and take turns to look up at objects whose light, often, had been emitted before any of these three viewers had been born—light from other centuries, only now reaching Earth. ©2017 by Mohsin Hamid

As used in the text, what does the word "reaching" most nearly mean?

- A. Arriving at
- B. Consulting with
- C. Running to
- D. Clinging to

## ID: aa7ae735 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The word "reaching" in this text means "to arrive" at Earth. Before, the light had been traveling across space; now, it had arrived at Earth.

Choice B is incorrect. "Consulting with" means "seeking advice or information from someone." Light is not alive, so it can't consult with Earth. Choice C is incorrect. It's confusing to say that starlight is "only now running to Earth," both because light doesn't literally "run" and because the text is describing the moment the light touches Earth, not the period of time when it's traveling to Earth. Choice D is incorrect. This might be tempting, as "clinging to" has a connotation of "sticking to." It wouldn't make sense to say that the light was "only now" clinging to Earth.

Some people have speculated that two helmets with attached horns discovered in 1942 belonged to Vikings, but scholars have long been skeptical. Archaeologist Helle Vandkilde and colleagues recently provided radiocarbon dates for the helmets, and their findings __________ scholars' skepticism: the helmets date to the Nordic Bronze Age, centuries before the Vikings existed.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. anticipate
- B. inspect
- C. reveal
- D. justify

## ID: 428cd2c1 Answer

Correct Answer: D

### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer because it most loqically completes the text's discussion of the helmets found in Denmark. In this context, "justify" means confirm or give reasons for. The text indicates that scholars have long been skeptical about the supposed Viking origin of two helmets found in Denmark. The radiocarbon dating of the helmets conducted by Vandkilde and colleagues demonstrates that the helmets date from the Nordic Bronze Age, making the helmets too old to have belonged to Vikings. This context supports the idea that the scholars' skepticism is justified.

Choice A is incorrect because "anticipate" means expect or come before, neither of which would make sense in context. The text indicates that scholars have long been skeptical of the idea that the helmets belonged to Vikings. Because the skepticism has existed for a long time, Vandkilde and colleagues' research couldn't be said to anticipate it. Instead, the radiocarbon dating results justify or confirm the scholar's skepticism. Choice B is incorrect because "inspect" means examine or review, which wouldn't make sense in this context. Research findings are inanimate and therefore unable to inspect scholars' skepticism. The text focuses on the origin of two helmets, which some people believe belonged to Vikings. Vandkilde and colleagues found that the helmets are from the Nordic Bronze Age and therefore much older than the Vikings. This context suggests that the researchers' findings justify, not inspect, the scholars' skepticism. Choice C is incorrect because "reveal" means uncover or report, which wouldn't make sense in context. The text focuses on the origin of two helmets, which some people believe belonged to Vikings. Vandkilde and colleagues tested the helmets and found that they date to the Nordic Bronze Age and therefore are much older than the Vikings. This context suggests that the researchers' findings confirm or justify the scholars' skepticism, which was already known so didn't need to be revealed.

The following text is from Booth Tarkington's 1921 novel Alice Adams.

Mrs. Adams had always been fond of vases, she said, and every year her husband's Christmas present to her was a vase of one sort or another—whatever the clerk showed him, marked at about twelve or fourteen dollars.

As used in the text, what does the word "marked" most nearly mean?

A. Staged

B. Priced

C. Stained

- D. Watched
ID: 82b7c3b2 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The text suggests that Mrs. Adam's typical Christmas present from her husband was a vase that cost, or was "priced at," about twelve or fourteen dollars.

Choice A is incorrect. This isn't the meaning of "marked" as used here. It wouldn't make sense to say that a vase was "staged at twelve or fourteen dollars." Choice C is incorrect. This isn't the meaning of "marked" as used here. It wouldn't make sense to say that a vase was "stained at twelve or fourteen dollars." Choice D is incorrect. This isn't the meaning of "marked" as used here. It wouldn't make sense to say that a vase was "watched at twelve or fourteen dollars."

As a young photographer in the 1950s, William Klein _________ the conventions of photography by creating images that were high contrast and included blurred and distorted elements—features generally seen as flaws. So unorthodox was Klein's work that he had difficulty finding a publisher for his now-iconic 1956 photo book Life is Good & Good for You in New York.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. reviewed
- B. defied
- C. respected
- D. prevented

## ID: aad56f2b Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. "Defied" or "deliberately disobeyed," which matches the way Klein broke from the conventions of photography in his time by including features that were generally seen as flaws.

Choice A is incorrect. "Reviewed" means "analyzed" or "evaluated," but that doesn't really fit the context here. Klein isn't directly providing any thoughtful examination of the conventions of photography; he's just breaking all the rules. Choice C is incorrect. "Respected" can mean "admired" (as in the case of conventions). It's clear that Klein didn't respect conventions, given his use of photographic features that were generally considered "Ilaws." Choice D is incorrect. "Prevented" means "stopped," and Klein did not stop the conventions-they still existed. Instead, he made images that were seen as "flawed" under those conventions.

Ronyoung Kim creatively captures the Korean American immigrant experience in her novel Clay Walls by writing about a family from three ____ perspectives. The first section of the nother Haesu's perspective, the second is from the father Chun's perspective, and the last is from the daughter Faye's perspective.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word?

- A. distinct
- B. required
- C. unintended
- D. unknown

### ID: 2390e956 Answer

#### Correct Answer: A

### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Ronyoung Kim's novel Clay Walls. In this context, "distinct" means clearly separate and different. The novel consists of three sections and that each section is narrated from the perspective of a different character. This context supports the idea that Kim's novel features three distinct perspectives.

Choice B is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim's novel as "required," or demanded as necessary to be done or provided, wouldn't make sense in context. When writing a novelist is free to choose to narrate the story from any number of perspectives. There's nothing in the text to indicate that providing three perspectives was demanded of Kim. Instead, the text focuses on identifying the three different perspectives featured in Kim's novel. Choice C is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim's novel as "unintended," or not planned as a purpose or goal, wouldn't make sense in context. Authors make deliberate choices about the perspectives they feature in their works, and the text indicates that Kim chose to incorporate three different perspectives in her novel. Choice D is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim's novel as "unknown," or not revealed, wouldn't make sense in context. The text directly identifies the three perspectives that appear in her novel as those of Faye and her two parents, Haesu and Chun, which indicates that the novel's perspectives are in fact known.

So, before sleeping, Latro records the important experiences of each day on a scroll, carefully choosing which ones to ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. suspect
- B. preserve
- C. suggest
- D. imagine

### ID: b507f90f Answer

#### Correct Answer: B

### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text about Latro, the main character in Gene Wolfe's novel Soldier of the Mist. In this context, "preserve" means save or keep from destruction or loss. The text describes Latro as a character who loses his memory whenever he sleeps. The text goes on to explain that before going to sleep, Latro records his most important memories to prevent him from forgetting, or losing, them. The context therefore supports the idea that Latro records his most important experiences in an effort to save, or preserve, his memory of them from loss.

Choice A is incorrect because "suspect" would mean mistrust, which wouldn't make sense in this context. The text emphasizes that in writing down his experiences, Latro carefully chooses those which are most important to him and thus worth remembering later, not that he is mistrustul or has reason to doubt the experiences he records. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "suggest" would mean propose for consideration. The text emphasizes the fact actually records those experiences that he has decided are most important to him, not that he merely proposes which experiences to consider for inclusion in his scroll. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "imagine" would either mean form a mental image of or fabricate, neither of which would logically complete the text. Although it's possible that reviewing records from previous days might enable Latro to reconstruct mental images of what has happened to him in the past, the text emphasizes the fact that Latro carefully selects and writes down his experiences so he will remember them in the future, not so that he can form mental pictures of them as he writes them down. In a similar vein, the text emphasizes that Latro is recording experiences that have actually happened to him, not that he's fabricating the experiences he records.

The following text is from Mark Oshiro's 2018 novel, Moss and his friends are on a subway train in Northern California.

Lights from the outside world then filled the train car as it rose out of the ground and climbed the elevated track. As long as Moss had lived in West Oakland, he'd never tired of this specific view, so he pointed toward the windows. "Check it," he said, and the Port of Oakland began to pass by them.

©2018 by Mark Oshiro

As used in the text, what does the word "specific" most nearly mean?

A. Imaginary

- B. Energetic
- C. Correct
- D. Particular

### ID: 2c82068f Answer

#### Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, "specific" most nearly means particular. The text is referring to the particular view of the Port of Oakland as seen from as it rises from underground. This specific, or particular, view has always been special to Moss, a lifetime resident of West Oakland.

Choice A is incorrect. Although the text itself is a work of fiction, the view is something Moss can point out to his companions on the train, so the view itself is presumably not imaginary. Although this view of the Port of Oakland is significant to Moss, nothing in the text describes the view as particularly energetic as opposed to calming, for example. Choice C is incorrect. The text is that the view of the Port of Oakland from the subway train as it rises from underground is significant to Moss, not whether it is described as being correct, which the text does not address.

The exhibit, which includes Lenape beadwork from the 1850s as well as modern works that use traditional patterns, is essential viewing.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. complicate
- B. amplify
- C. overlook
- D. assemble

#### ID: dc0bca21 Answer

#### Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of an exhibit at the Brooklyn Public Library. In this context, "overlook" means to ignore or to miss. The text states that artist and curator Joe Baker organized an exhibit that features Lenape beadwork in historical and modern works. The exhibit as "essential viewing"," suggesting that it's an important exhibit that people should make an effort to visit; this context conveys that it would be a mistake to overlook the exhibit.

Choice A is incorrect. In this context, "complicate" would mean to add difficulty, and there's no reason to think the text would need to directly caution against complicating Baker's exhibit; the text focuses on the idea that the exhibit is "essential viewing," not on the idea of a potential difficulty that could be raised. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, "amplify" means to increase, and there's no reason to believe the text would be a mistake to increase an exhibit the text describes as "essential viewing." Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense to say that it would be a mistake to "assemble," or put together, Baker's exhibit: the text makes it clear that the exhibit has already been put together and, further, praises the exhibit as "essential viewing."

©2021 by Darcie Little Badger

As used in the text, what does the word "featured" most nearly mean?

- A. Displayed
- B. Questioned
- C. Approved
- D. Ignored

#### ID: 417f8dfa Answer

#### Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "featured" means displayed. The text describes Nina's fascination with a framed photograph. It then goes on to describe what the photograph showed, or displayed, which is a portrait of Nina's great-grandmother Rosita as a young woman. Thus, the text indicates that the photograph displayed a portrait of Rosita.

Choice B is incorrect because the text identifies the person shown in the photograph as Nina's great-grandmother, it gives no indication that the contents of the photograph were questioned, or asked about. Choice C is incorrect because approved means expressed a favorable opinion of, and there's nothing to suggest that the photograph of Nina's great-greatgrandmother has received approval or been viewed favorably, only that Nina is unable to stop looking at it. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the photograph Nina is fascinated with ignored, or refused to take notice of, Nina's great-great-grandmother Rosita. Rather, the text indicates that the photograph was a portrait of Rosita.

She and her colleagues have found that the site's age differs from the ____________________ estimately 20 years older than scholars thought when first encountering Machu Picchu in 1911.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. genuine
- B. intentional
- C. independent
- D. original

## ID: 52fe862a Answer

#### Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the dating of Machu Picchu. In this context, "original" means first or initial. The text indicates that Lucy Salazar and her colleagues have determined the age of Machu Picchu and that the age differs from another estimate of the site's age, explaining that the site is about 20 years older than scholars thought in 1911 when they initially encountered Machu Picchu. In other words, Salazar and her team found that the site's age differs from the first estimate.

Choice A is incorrect. The text's structure indicates that the missing word describes the estimate made by scholars when they first encountered Machu Picchu in 1911 in relation to the age determined by Salazar and her colleagues. It wouldn't make sense to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was "genuine," or actual and true, while the one by Salazar's team wasn't, since the text treats the finding by Salazar's team as invalidating the earlier estimate ("it is approximately 20 years older than scholars thought"). Choice B is incorrect. The text's structure indicates that the missing word describes the estimate made by scholars when they first encountered Machu Picchu in 1911 in relation to the age determined by Salazar and her colleagues. It wouldn't make sense to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was "intentional," or done on purpose, while the one by Salazar's team wasn't; the text indicates that Salazar and her colleagues were deliberately using radiocarbon dating to study Machu Picchu. Choice C is incorrect. The text's structure indicates that the missing word describes the estimate made by scholars when they first encountered Machu Picchu in 1911 in relation to the age determined by Salazar and her colleagues. There's no reason to suggest that the estimate was "independent," or not controlled by or affiliated with others, while the one by Salazar's team wasn't; there's no mention of any outside influence on the work by Salazar and her team or by scholars in 1911.

"Do you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty? How nice and soft it sounds! Just as if someone was kissing the window all over outside."

As used in the text, what does the word "soft" most nearly mean?

- A. Gentle
- B. Sensitive
- C. Shapeless
- D. Bland

## ID: 05575bca Answer

#### Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "soft" most neans gentle. The text portrays Alice speaking about the snow falling against the window, describing it as sounding "nice" and similar to someone "kissing the window" These details most strongly suggest that Alice thinks the sound made by the snow falling against the window is gentle.

Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, "gentle" can mean sensitive, or caring about others' feelings, that isn't the meaning in this context; it doesn't make sense to say that Alice thinks the sound of the snow cares about anything. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that Alice thinks the sound of the snow is shapeless, or lacks a definite shape; she isn't indicating how anything looks or feels but, rather, is describing how "nice" and gentle the snow sounds. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that Alice thinks the sound of the snow is bland, or uninteresting; rather, she notices the sound and comments on how "nice" it is.

[A] younger and less cautious man would long since have spoken. But he had made up his mind, and had only to determine the time when he would ask her to be his wife. He decided to give a ball in her honor, and at some time during the evening of the ball to offer her his heart and hand.

As used in the text, what does the word "determine" most nearly mean?

- A. Choose
- B. Influence
- C. Demonstrate
- D. Measure

## ID: edd64a4a Answer

#### Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "determine" most nearly means choose or decide. The text indicates that Mr. Ryder "had made up his mind" to ask a woman to marry him but had not yet "spoken" - that is, he had not yet asked her. The text also indicates that Mr. Ryder "decided" to throw a party for the woman and ask her during it. This context conveys that after making up his mind to propose, what Mr. Ryder had to do was determine, or choose, the time to do it.

Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "determine" doesn't mean influence, or affect or control. The text isn't indicating that Mr. Ryder is controlling time itself; such a thing isn't possible. Rather, the text conveys that after making up his mind to ask a woman to marry him, Mr. Ryder had to make another decision about his own actions by selecting a time to propose. Choice C is incorrect. The text focuses on Mr. Ryder's plan to ask a woman to marry him and his decision about when to ask her. This context conveys that after making up his mind to propose, Mr. Ryder had to choose the time, not that he had to demonstrate, or show, the time; it's not clear what it would mean to demonstrate a time. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "determine" doesn't mean measure, or control with careful restraint. The text indicating that Mr. Ryder is carefully controlling time itself; such a thing isn't possible. Rather, the text conveys that after making up his mind to ask a woman to marry him, Mr. Ryder had to make another decision about his own actions by selecting a time to propose, it's Mr. Ryder's decision that is measured, not the time he eventually chooses.

When marine biologist Brittany Williams played different ocean recordings to groups of oyster larvae, groups that heard sounds of a healthy oyster reef were the most _____ They were twice as likely as other groups to show signs of making a permanent home. This suggests that playing recordings of a healthy ocean reef may encourage oysters to create such a reef.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. responsive
- B. inactive
- C. liked
- D. distressed

## ID: 03f5a9b7 Answer

#### Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of oysters and ocean recordings. As used in this context, "responsive" means reacting positively. The text presents a finding and describes it as suggesting that healthy ocean sounds may encourage oyster larvae to establish a reef (a permanent home): groups of oyster larvae that heard recorded sounds of a heathy oyster reef were two times more likely to show signs of forming their own reef than groups that heard different ocean recordings were. This context conveys that heard healthy reef sounds had a more positive reaction than the other groups did=that is, they were the most responsive.

Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn't indicate that hearing sounds of a healthy oyster reef caused some groups of oyster larvae to become "inactive," or to stop engaging in work or activity. Instead, the text conveys that heard those sounds were observed engaging in activity: they were two times more likely to create a reef (a permanent home) than groups that heard different ocean sounds were. Choice C is incorrect because describing the groups of oyster larvae that heard sounds of a healthy oyster reef as most "liked," or regarded with pleasure, wouldn't make sense in context. The text focuses on the idea that a study found that healthy reef sounds may encourage groups of oyster larvae to form reefs (permanent homes), not on the idea that some of the study were liked more than others. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't indicate that hearing sounds of a healthy oyster reef caused some groups of oyster larvae to be "distressed," or to experience difficulty or begin to decline. Instead, the text indicates that the likelihood that groups of larvae would establish a reef (a permanent home), suggesting that the sounds had a positive effect on the larvae.

Manul cats are small, shy felines. They live mostly alone in out-of-the-way parts of Asia, such as on Mount Everest. These cats have been difficult to research because their habitats are so ______ large populations of humans.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. full of
- B. drawn to
- C. responsible for
- D. distant from

## ID: afd2a9eb Answer

#### Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of manul cats. The text states that manul cats live in "out-of-the-way parts of Asia" (citing the famously remote Mount Everest as an example) and indicates that it is difficult to research the cats becation of their habitats. By emphasizing that the habitats are remote in relation to humans, the text conveys that being "distant from," or far from, large groups of humans makes manul cats challenging to study.

Choice A is incorrect because saying that the habitats of manul cats are "full of large populations of humans" would indicate that the cats cohabitate with many humans, which would directly contradict the text's live in "out-of-theway" areas. Choice B is incorrect because the missing words describe an aspect of manul cats' habitats, or the areas where they live, and it wouldn't make sense to say that areas could be "drawn to," or attracted by, large groups of humans. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, "responsible for" would mean either having an obligation to care for something or being the cause of something, and it wouldn't make sense to say that the habitats of manul cats live) would need to care for humans or that the habitats somehow created large human populations.

Archaeologist Erika Karuzas works with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana to preserve culturally significant sites. In 2015 they decided that creating a new national trail connecting many of these sites would______________________________________________________________ their preservation efforts, because the US qovernment provides some protections to national trails that aren't given to other areas.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?

- A. inspire
- B. ignore
- C. promote
- D. reduce

## ID: 5514fd1f Answer

#### Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the preservation efforts undertaken by Erika Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana. In this context, "promote" means play a part in the success or growth of something or someone. The text indicates that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes work to preserve culturally important sites. It goes on to say that their decision to create a national trail connecting the sites was motivated by the fact that such a trail would receive protections from the US qovernment that the sites wouldn't otherwise receive. Thus, such a decision would promote the preservation efforts.

Choice A is incorrect because "inspire" means motivate or influence, which wouldn't make sense in context. The text establishes that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana work to preserve culturally significant sites and that their decision to create a new national trail occurred as a result of a desire to the sites that they wouldn't otherwise receive. Thus, creating the trail wouldn't inspire the sites; instead, it would promote the efforts. Choice B is incorrect because "ignore" means overlook, which wouldn't make sense in context. The text indicates that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana work to preserve culturally significant sites and that they decided to create a national trail connecting the sites because such a trail would receive protections from the US government that the sites wouldn't otherwise receive. Thus, the trail would promote, not ignore, the preservation efforts. Choice D is incorrect because "reduce" means decrease or restrict, which wouldn't make sense in context. The text indicates that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana work to preserve culturally significant sites and that they decided to create a national trail connecting the sites because such a trail would receive protections from the US government that the sites wouldn't otherwise receive. The decision would therefore promote, not reduce, the preservation efforts.

The following text is adapted from José Martí's 1891 poem "At the Salon" (translated by Cecil Charles in 1898). The speaker describes a painting featuring a female figure.

From the sterile soil no ray Of hope in a blade of green, Nor sheltering roof is seen-

Who stole away my heart Though the skies are heavy and gray. Ah, this is the woman fair In the splendid halls of art Yester-e'en as I wandered there!

As used in the text, what does the word "sheltering" most nearly mean?

- A. Protective
- B. Restrictive
- C. Affectionate
- D. Suspicious

## ID: 6cf906fc Answer

#### Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "sheltering" most nearly means protective. In the text, the speaker describes a painting featuring a female figure. The speaker ultimately confesses to falling in love with the woman in the painting, who has "stolen) away" the speaker's heart, but first the speaker describes elements of the setting. These include sterile soil, barren fields with "no ray / Of hope in a blade of green"-a description that conveys a mood of melancholy and forlornness, possibly reflecting the speaker's own sadness at falling in love with an image that can't return the speaker's love. The text continues by stating that there's no "sheltering roof" in the "skies are heavy and gray" showing signs of an impending storm. Generally, a roof's intended purpose is to provide protection from the elements, and in this context, a roof would offer shelter and protection from the gathering storm.

Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that a roof would be restrictive—that is, that it would limit or restrain something in some way. Although a roof would provide some cover from stormy winds and rain, it wouldr't limit the wind and rain, only deflect them. Choice t is incorrect because there's nothing in the text to suggest that if a "sheltering roof" were present in the painting, it would be affectionate, or loving and tender. In the immediate context in which the word "sheltering" appears refers to the absence of a roof that would provide protection from the oncoming storm depicted in the painting, not to the idea that such a shelter would be loving and tender if it were present. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, suspicious would mean questionable or dubious, and there's nothing in the text to suggest that if any roofs were present in the painting, they would be questionable or cause any suspicion.
