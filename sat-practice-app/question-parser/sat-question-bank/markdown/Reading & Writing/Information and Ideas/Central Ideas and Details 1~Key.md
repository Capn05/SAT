1.1

The following text is adapted from Johanna Spyri's 1881 novel Heidi (translated by Elisabeth Stork in 1915). Eightyear-old Heidi and her friend's grandmother are looking at some illustrated books.

Heidi had come and was looking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures in the large books, that Grandmama was showing her. Suddenly she screamed aloud, for there on the picture she saw a peaceful flock grazing on a green pasture. In the middle a shepherd was standing, leaning on his crook. The setting sun was shedding a golden light over everything. With glowing eyes Heidi devoured the scene.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

- A. Heidi is upset until she sees a serene image of a pasture in one of Grandmama's books.
- B. Heidi is delighted and fascinated by an image she sees in one of Grandmama's books.
- C. Heidi is initially frightened by an image in one of Grandmama's books but quickly comes to appreciate its beauty.
- D. Heidi is inspecting an image in one of Grandmama's books because she has never seen a shepherd with his sheep before.

### ID: 57485f5e Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively states the main idea of the text, which is that Heidi is delighted and fascinated by an image she sees in one of Grandmama's books. In the text, Heidi screams upon first seeing the picture of the green pasture. In another context, such a reaction might suggest fear, but here the reaction is followed by descriptions of an image that's peaceful rather than scary. The text goes on to describe Heid's eyes as "glowing" and states that she "devoured the scene" suggesting that the image delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail. Together, these descriptions suggest that Heidi is thrilled and intrigued by the image in the book.

Choice A is incorrect because there's nothing in the text to suggest that Heidi is upset before seeing the peaceful image of the green pasture. Before Heidi sees that image, the text describes her as "looking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures" in the book, suggesting that Heidi is intrigued, not that she's unhappy. Choice C is incorrect. Although Heidi screams upon first seeing the text's description of the image and Heidi's other reactions to it suggest that she is screaming with delight, not fear. The text describes the images in the book as "splendid" and the particular image that causes her to scream as peaceful rather than frightening. It also describes Heidi's eyes as "glowing" and states that she "devoured the scene", suggesting that the image of the green pasture delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail. Choice D is incorrect because it's unclear from the text whether Heidi has ever seen a shepherd

{1}------------------------------------------------

with his sheep before. The text merely suggests that she is delighted and fascinated by the image of the shepherd and his sheep.

Scent is tightly interwoven with our daily lives, often evoking significant memories and important social events. This connection is of growing interest to archaeologists who hope to use it to better understand ancient rituals, trade, social hierarchies, and medicine. Although the speed at which odor molecules dissipate makes identifying ancient scents challenging, advancements in biomolecular technologies show promise in unlocking ancient aromas from preserved artifacts. Archaeological studies making use of these advancements may provide new insights into past societies.

According to the text, what is one reason some archaeologists are interested in recovering scents from ancient artifacts?

A. They are investigating whether people's sense of smell has declined in recent centuries.

- B. They believe the scents could illuminate important aspects of ancient life.
- C. They think that ancient scents would be enjoyable to people today.
- D. They hope to develop new medicines using ancient scent molecules.

ID: 8a8236e1 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The text states that archaeologists are interested in using scents to better understand "ancient rituals, trade, social hierarchies, and medicine," all of which are important aspects of ancient life.

Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn't say anything about investigating if people's sense of smell has declined in recent centuries. It says that scents fade over time-not that people have gotten worse at smelling scents. Choice C is incorrect. The text says that archaeologists are interested in using scents to better understand "ancient rituals, trade, social hierarchies, and medicine," but it doesn't say anything about ancient scents being enjoyable to people today. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn't say anything about developing new medicines. Rather, it says that archaeologists are interested in using scents to better understand "ancient rituals, trade, social hierarchies, and medicine."

1.3

Bicycles were first mass-produced in the late nineteenth century throughout Europe and North America, allowing individuals remarkable freedom to travel longer distances quickly and comfortably. This freedom, coupled with the affordability of the vehicle, made the bicycle immensely popular. Individuals were able to live farther from their workplaces, easily visit neighboring towns, and participate in new leisure and sport activities. Bicycling quickly became a popular social endeavor, with enthusiasts forming local cycling clubs to enjoy these newfound activities with others.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

A. The widespread adoption of the bicycle in the late nineteenth century provided new opportunities for people.

B. The affordability of the bicycle in the late nineteenth century made it the preferred way to travel.

C. The popularity of the bicycle in the late nineteenth century gave rise to the first cycling clubs.

D. The mass production of the bicycle in the late nineteenth century made it safer for people to use.

ID: 2592e0de Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The text discusses how the mass production of bicycles in the late nineteenth century allowed people to travel longer distances, live farther from their workplaces, visit neighboring towns, and participate in new activities and social clubs. All of these are new opportunities that were provided by the widespread adoption of the bicycle.

Choice B is incorrect. The text never says this. It does say that the bicycle was "affordable" and that the "freedom to travel longer distances quickly and comfortably" made the bicycle "popular" but it never says that the bicycle was more popular than any of traveling (like cars or trains or horses). Choice C is incorrect. This is a detail mentioned in the text, but not the main idea. Cycling clubs are only one of the new opportunities that arose from the popularity of the mass-produced bicycle. A "main idea" should capture more of the information in the text. Choice D is incorrect. The text never says this. It doesn't mention the safety of the mass-produced bicycle at all.

Artist Justin Favela explained that he wanted to reclaim the importance of the piñata as a symbol in Latinx culture. To do so, he created numerous sculptures from strips of tissue paper, which is similar to the material used to create piñatas. In 2017, Favela created an impressive life-size piñata-like sculpture of the Gypsy Rose lowrider car, which was displayed at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, California. The Gypsy Rose lowrider was famously driven by Jesse Valadez, an early president of the Los Angeles Imperials Car Club.

According to the text, which piece of Favela's art was on display in the Petersen Automotive Museum in 2017?

- A. A painting of Los Angeles
- B. A sculpture of a lowrider car
- C. A painting of a piñata
- D. A sculpture of Jesse Valadez

#### ID: 89961e26 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The text describes Favela's approach to sculpture, and then describes the lownider car that he depicted in 2017.

Choice A is incorrect. This isn't what the text says. The Petersen Automotive Museum is located in Los Angeles, but Favela's artwork isn't a painting, and it doesn't depict L.A. Choice C is incorrect. This isn't what the text says. Favela makes sculptures similar to piñatas, not paintings of them. Choice D is incorrect. This isn't what the text says. Jesse Valadez owned the lowrider car that Favela depicted in sculpture.

In 2022, researchers rediscovered ancient indigenous glyphs, or drawings, on the walls of a cave in Alabama. The cave's ceiling was only a few feet high, affording no position from which the glyphs, being as ten feet, could be viewed or photographed in their entirety. However, the researchers used a technique called photogrammetry to assemble numerous photos of the walls into a 3D model. They then worked with representatives of tribes originally from the region, including the Chickasaw Nation, to understand the significance of the animal and humanoid figures adorning the cave.

According to the text, what challenge did the researchers have to overcome to examine the glyphs?

- A. The cave was so remote that the researchers couldn't easily reach it.
- B. Some of the glyphs were so faint that they couldn't be photographed.
- C. The researchers were unable to create a 3D model of the cave.
- D. The cave's dimensions prevented the researchers from fully viewing the glyphs.

ID: de0a5b4e Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The text describes the very low ceiling of the cave, making it impossible to photograph the very wide glyphs all at once.

Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn't say this. It never suggests that the cave was remote or difficult to access, just that the cave itself was difficult to photograph well. Choice B is incorrect. The text doesn't say this. The glyphs were so wide that they couldn't be photographed completely. Choice C is incorrect. The text states the opposite of this. The researchers "used a technique called photogrammetry to assemble numerous photos of the walls into a 3D model."

The following text is from Shyam Selvadurai's 1994 novel Funny Boy. The seven-year-old narrator lives with his family in Sri Lanka. Radha Aunty is the narrator's aunt.

Radha Aunty, who was the youngest in my father's family, had left for America four years ago when I was three, and I could not remember what she looked like. I went into the corridor to look at the family photographs that were hung there. But all the pictures were old ones, taken when Radha Aunty was a baby or young girl. Try as I might, I couldn't get an idea of what she looked like now. My imagination, however, was quick to fill in this void. ©1994 by Shyam Selvadurai.

According to the text, why does the narrator consult some family photographs?

- A. He wants to use the photographs as inspiration for a story he is writing.
- B. He is curious about how his father dressed a long time ago.
- C. He hopes the photographs will help him recall what his aunt looked like.
- D. He wants to remind his aunt of an event that is shown in an old photograph.

#### ID: 6675c5c3 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The text states that the narrator couldn't remember what his Radha Aunty looked like, so he went to look at the family photographs she was in.

Choice A is incorrect. There's no mention of any story that the narrator is writing. Rather, we're told that the narrator couldn't remember what his aunt looked like, so he went to look at the family photographs she was in. Choice B is incorrect. The text doesn't mention's father dressed. Rather, we're told that the narrator couldn't remember what his aunt looked like, so he went to look at the family photographs she was in. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn't mention any events shown in the photographs. Rather, we're told that the narrator couldn't remember what his aunt looked like, so he went to look at the family photographs she was in.

NASA's Cassini probe has detected an unusual wobble in the rotation of Mimas, Saturn's smallest moon. Using a computer model to study Mimas's gravitational interactions with Saturn and tidal forces, geophysicist Alyssa Rhoden and colleagues have proposed that this wobble could be due to a liguid ocean moving beneath the moon's icy surface. The researchers believe other moons should be examined to see if they too might have oceans hidden beneath their surfaces.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

- A. Rhoden and colleagues were the first to confirm that several of Saturn's moons contain hidden oceans.
- B. Research has failed to identify signs that there is an ocean hidden beneath the surface of Mimas.
- C. Rhoden and colleagues created a new computer model that identifies moons with hidden oceans without needing to analyze the moons' rotation.
- D. Research has revealed that an oddity in the rotation of Mimas could be explained by an ocean hidden beneath its surface.

#### ID: 0b696a0c Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The study isn't definitive, but it says that Mimas's wobbly rotation could be explained by the hidden ocean.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice goes too far beyond the information in the text. Rhoden's team proposed that one moon of Saturn could have a liquid ocean beneath its surface, and that other moons should also be examined, but no one has confirmed anything. Choice B is incorrect. This choice conflicts with the text. Research has identified at least one sign – the unusual wobble in Mimas's rotation – that might be due to a hidden ocean beneath its surface. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn't reflect the text. The computer model studies "gravitational interactions," which seem to account for the wobbly rotation of Mimas.

Shimmering is a collective defense behavior that researchers have observed in giant honeybee colonies. When shimmering, different groups of bees flip their bodies up and down in what looks like waves. This defense is initiated when hornets hover near a colony, serving to deter the hornets from approaching the bees. Researchers hypothesize that this behavior is a specialized defense response to hornets, as it is not observed when other, larger predators approach the colony.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

A. Researchers are unsure how giant honeybees defend against predators larger than hornets.

B. Researchers think that shimmering in giant honeybees is a specific defense against hornets.

C. Hornets are known to be the main predator of giant honeybees.

D. Several different species of insects use shimmering to defend against hornets.

ID: 23a7038f Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The text describes a study about how giant honeybees use shimmering to defend against hornets, but not other predators. The researchers conclude that shimmering could be a specialized defense response to hornets.

Choice A is incorrect. The text says that giant honeybees don't appear to use shimmering against other, larger predators. However, it never suggests that researchers don't know which other defenses giant honeybees do use for those predators. Choice C is incorrect. The text says that hornets are one predator of giant honeybees, but it doesn't say that hornets are the main predator of giant honeybees. This choice also fails to mention "shimmering," which is a major focus of the text. Choice D is incorrect. The text only discusses the shimmering of giant honeybees-it doesn't discuss other insects' defense responses at all.

Oluwaseyi Moeioh cofounded U-recycle Initiative Africa when she was only a teenager. Moejoh and her team founded the organization to teach young people how their actions affect the environment and why recycling is important. For example, the organization put on an exhibit of art made using recycled materials.

According to the text, what is one reason Moejoh and others founded U-recycle Initiative Africa?

- A. To bring attention to overlooked African artists
- B. To teach young people why recycling is important
- C. To help adults gain important outdoor skills
- D. To give teenagers advice about starting businesses

#### ID: 7921b86b Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it describes a reason that Moejoh and team founded U-recycle Initiative Africa. The text mentions two reasons the initiative was founded: to teach young people about how they affect the environment and to teach them "why recycling is important." Thus, teaching the importance of recycling to young people accurately describes a motivation that the text cites as a reason for the initiative's founding.

Choice A is incorrect. Although art is mentioned in the text, there are no details about artists or whether they are being overlooked. Choice C is incorrect because the text is explicitly about young people and their relationship to the environment and recycling. There is no mention of adults or outdoor skills. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text discusses young people, which likely includes teenagers, there is no mention of starting businesses.

Microplastics are pieces of plastic that are smaller than a grain of rice. These small plastics can be found in large quantities in ocean waters. Ecologist Jessica Reichert and her team are studying the role reef-building corals have in capturing microplastics from ocean waters. Through research, her team has found that these corals may be storing up to 20 million kilograms of microplastics each year in their skeletons and tissues.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

- A. Ecologists are interested in learning more about how certain corals build large reefs.
- B. Questions remain around the impact certain corals have on ocean ecosystems.
- C. Microplastics are small pieces of plastic that can be found in ocean waters.
- D. Ecologists predict that corals store large amounts of microplastics from ocean waters.

#### ID: dc5edbf6 Answer

Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The text describes a study about how reef-building corals capture microplastics from ocean waters, which found that these corals are storing 20 million kilograms of microplastics in their skeletons and tissues.

Choice A is incorrect. While the researchers are studying "reef-building corals," the focus of their study isn't how the corals build the reefs. Rather, they're studying how corals may be storing microplastics from ocean waters. Choice B is incorrect. The text doesn't mention any unanswered questions about the impact of corals on ocean ecosystems-rather, the study assesses one interaction between corals and microplastics. Choice C is incorrect. The text does say this, but it's a detail—not the main idea of the text is about the study that found that corals may be storing microplastics from ocean waters in their skeletons and tissues.

Psychologists wanted to test how young children think about rewards and fairness. In an experiment, two teachers handed out rewards while children (ages four to six) watched. The teachers gave out the same number of rewards, but one of them counted the rewards out loud. The children were then asked who was fairer. 73% chose the teacher who counted. The psychologists think that counting showed the children that the teacher wanted to be fair. The children may have believed that the teacher who did not count did not care about fairness.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

- A. Psychologists think children cannot understand the concept of fairness until they are six years old.
- B. An experiment found that counting out loud is the best way to teach mathematical concepts to children.
- C. Psychologists think young children expect to be rewarded when the children show that they care about fairness.
- D. An experiment showed that the way rewards are given out may affect whether young children think the situation is fair.

#### ID: d8758c3b Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The text describes a study assessing how children think of rewards and fairness and its results. It concludes that the children in the study may have thought that a teacher who counted out loud when giving rewards cared more about fairness than a teacher who did not count out loud.

Choice A is incorrect. The children in the study are described as being "four to six," and the text doesn't mention any differences among the different ages. Choice B is incorrect. The experiment wasn't about teaching mather, it was about how counting out loud affected the children's perception of fairness. Choice C is incorrect. The experiment doesn't focus on whether the children care about fairness, and the text never mentions the children's expectations of being rewarded.

Scrapbooks of saved fabric pieces were commonly kept by women in the nineteenth-century United States, but few are as meticulously detailed as Hannah Ditzler Alspaugh's work. Alongside each piece of fabric, Alspaugh recorded intimate memories, such as dressmaking with her sister. Additionally, she listed the prices and how she used the fabric. Historians note that by representing fifty years of changing textures, and dress styles, the scrapbook is a record of nineteenth-century textiles and dressmaking as well as Alspaugh's life.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

- A. Alspaugh inspired other women to save pieces of fabric in scrapbooks and provide historical records of nineteenth-century fashions in the United States.
- B. Historians rely on fabric scrapbooks to understand how fashions changed throughout the nineteenth-century United States.
- C. Fabric scrapbooks were a popular hobby for many women in the nineteenth-century United States.
- D. Alspaugh's scrapbook provides a detailed account of her life and historical record of fashion trends in the nineteenth-century United States.

### ID: 0e3b4967 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. The text describes how Alspaugh's scrapbook is both a record of her life and a historical record of nineteenth-century textiles and dressmaking.

Choice A is incorrect. The text says that it was common for American women to keep scrapbooks of fabric pieces in the nineteenth century, and it says that Alspaugh was one of these women. However, it never says that other women were inspired by Alspaugh. Choice B is incorrect. This is too general and too strong. The text says that Alspaugh's scrapbook is a historical record of nineteenth-century textiles and dressmaking, but it never says that historians rely on such scrapbooks in general to understand how fashions changed throughout that time period. This choice also fails to even mention Alspaugh, who is the real focus of the text. Choice C is incorrect. The text does say this, but it's a detail-not the main idea. The text is mainly about one woman's scrapbook (Alspaugh's), and this choice doesn't even mention her.

To make her art more widely available, graphic artist Elizabeth Catlett turned to linocut printing, an artist carves an image into a sheet of linoleum to create a stamp that is used to mass-produce prints. In the linocut series The Black Woman (1946–1947), Catlett depicts the everyday experiences of Black women alongside the achievements of well-known Black women. This pairing invites the viewer to draw connections among the women. The linocut process enabled Catlett's work to reach a wide audience and supported her aim to unite Black women through her art.

According to the text, what is significant about Catlett's use of linocut printing?

- A. Linocut printing involved using materials that were readily available to Catlett.
- B. Linocut printing helped Catlett use art to connect people, especially Black women.
- C. Catlett became commercially successful once she started using linocut printing.
- D. Catlett was one of the first Black artists to use linocut printing.

ID: a842db60 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The last sentence states that the linocut process "supported her [Catlett's] aim to unite Black women through her art."

Choice A is incorrect. The text briefly describes the linocut printing process but doesn't discuss the availability of the materials used in the process. Choice C is incorrect. The text says that the linocut process "enabled Catlett's work to reach a wide audience," but that doesn't mean that linocuts made her "commercially successful." In other words, we don't know how much money she made off her linocuts-we only know that more people were able to see her work. Choice D is incorrect. The text says that Catlett depicted Black women in her linocuts, but not that she was one of the first Black artists to use linocut printing.

The following text is from Edith Nesbit's 1902 novel Five Children and It. Five young siblings have just moved with their parents from London to a house in the countryside that they call the White House.

lt was not really a pretty house at all; it was quite ordinary, and mother thought it was rather inconvenient, and was quite annoyed at there being no shelves, to speak of, and hardly a cupboard in the place. Father used to say that the ironwork on the roof and coping was like an architect's nightmare. But the house was deep in the country, with no other house in sight, and the children had been in London for two years, without so much as once going to the seaside even for a day by an excursion train, and so the White House seemed to them a sort of Fairy Palace set down in an Earthly Paradise.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

- A. Although their parents believe the house has several drawbacks, the children are enchanted by it.
- B. The children don't like the house nearly as much as their parents do.
- C. Each member of the family admires a different characteristic of the house.
- D. The house is beautiful and well built, but the children miss their old home in London.

### ID: 1e85caa9 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The text lists complaints about the house made by the mother and father, but then it says that the children thought the house was a "Fairy Palace" and "Earthly Paradise."

Choice B is incorrect. The text states the opposite of this. It describes how the mother and father dislike the house and says the children think the house seems like paradise. Choice C is incorrect. This isn't what the text says. Only the children are said to admire the house; mother and father both complain about the house. Choice D is incorrect. The text states the opposite of this. It tells us the house was ugly and poorly built ("an architect's nightmare") and suggests the children were tired of London.

The following text is from Beatrice Harraden's 1894 novel Ships that Pass in the Night.

In an old second-hand bookshop in London, an old man sat reading Gibbon's History of Rome. He did not put down his book when the postman brought him a letter. He just glanced indifferently at the letter, and impatiently at the postman. Zerviah Holme did not like to be interrupted when he was reading Gibbon; and as he was always reading Gibbon, an interruption was always regarded by him as an insult.

Based on the text, how did Zerviah Holme most likely feel when the letter was delivered?

- A. He felt relieved because he had been expecting an important letter.
- B. He felt excited because the letter was from a good friend.
- C. He felt sad because the postman did not stop to talk with him before leaving.
- D. He felt annoyed because he was interrupted while reading his favorite author.

### ID: 41d5c33e Answer

#### Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer because it presents a description of how felt that is directly supported by the text. The text states that Holme "did not like to be interrupted" while reading Gibbon and that he considered interruptions to be "an insult." Furthermore, the text suggests that Gibbon is Holme's favorite author because, as the was always reading Gibbon." Thus, Holme would have felt annoyed at having been interrupted when the letter was delivered.

Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that Holme is receive the letter. Instead, the text states that Holme "just glanced indifferently at the letter", suggesting that the letter wasn't important to him. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that Holme is excited to receive the text states that Holme didn't put down his book to receive the letter and that he letter "indifferently" and at the postman "impatiently." This suggests that Holme isn't excited. Also, there is no mention that Holme knows who sent the letter. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't indicate that Holme is sad or that he wants to speak with the postman. Instead, the text describes Holme as looking "impatiently at the postman," which suggests that he wants the postman to leave.
