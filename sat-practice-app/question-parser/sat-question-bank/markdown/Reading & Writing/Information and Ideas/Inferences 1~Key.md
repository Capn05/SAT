Microbes that live in shallow lakes and ponds produce methane, a harmful greenhouse gas. Ecologist Ralf Aben and his team wanted to see how different types of shallow-water plants might affect the amount of methane that escapes into the atmosphere. Aben's team set up some water tanks with soil and microbes from local ponds. Some tanks had a type of underwater plant that grows in the soil called watermilfoil. Other tanks had either duckweed, a type of plant that floats on the water's surface, or algae. Aben and his team found that tanks with duckweed and algae released higher levels of methane than tanks with watermilfoil did. This finding suggests that

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. the presence of some kinds of underwater plants like watermilfoil helps prevent methane from escaping shallow lakes and ponds.
- B. shallow lakes and ponds release more methane than deeper bodies of water because shallow bodies of water usually have more plants than deep bodies of water do.
- C. shallow lakes and ponds are more likely to contain either watermilfoil or duckweed.
- D. having a mix of algae, underwater plants is the best way to reduce the amount of methane in shallow lakes and ponds.

#### ID: 01989d77 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The passage tells us that "tanks with duckweed (a floating plant) and algae released higher levels of methane than tanks with waterwater plant) did." This suggests that the presence of some kinds of underwater plants like watermilfoil may help prevent methane from escaping shallow lakes and ponds.

Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention deeper bodies of water at all, so there's no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn't compare the likelihood of shallow lakes and ponds containing algae, watermilfoil, or duckweed. Choice D is incorrect. The study didn't include any tanks with a mix of plants, so there's no basis for this inference.

In their book Smart Pricing, Jagmohan Raju and Z. John Zhang consicians' use of the nontraditional "pay as you wish" pricing model. This model generally offers listeners the choice to pay more or less than a suggested price for a song or album—or even to pay nothing at all. As the authors note, that's the option most listeners chose for an album by the band Harvey Danger. Only about 1% opted to pay for the album, resulting in earnings below the band's expectations. But the authors also discuss musician Jane Significant earnings from her "pay as you wish" online music store as a result of many listeners choosing to pay more than the store's suggested prices. Hence, the "pay as you wish" model may ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Which choice most logically completes the text?

A. prove financially successful for some musicians but disappointing for others.

B. hold greater financial appeal for bands than for individual musicians.

C. cause most musicians who use the model to lower the suggested prices of their songs and albums over time.

D. more strongly reflect differences in certain musicians' popularity than traditional pricing models do.

#### ID: 4603d1f7 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. In one example, musicians made less money than expected by using the "pay as you wish" model. In the other example, a musician made more money than expected. This suggests that some musicians may have more success than others using the "pay as you wish" model.

Choice B is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. In the examples provided, the individual musician was more successful with the "pay as you wish" model than the band was. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The passage provides no instances in which musicians changed the suggested prices of their songs or albums, nor does it mention this as a possibility. Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text never discusses the differences in popularity of different musicians, so there is no basis to make this inference.

Arthur Conan Doyle's stories about detective Sherlock Holmes were published between 1887 and 1927. They have inspired countless successful adaptations, including comic strips, movies, and a television series Sherlock Hound, directed by Hayao Miyazaki, who is celebrated for his animated movies. Until 2014, these stories were copyrighted. The right to adapt was only available to those who could afford the and gain approval from the strict copyright holders of Doyle's estate. Some journalists predict that the number of Sherlock Holmes adaptations is likely to increase since the end of copyright means that _

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. Doyle's original stories will become hard to find.
- B. people will become more interested in detective stories than they were in the 1800s.
- C. producing adaptations will become easier and less expensive.
- D. the former copyright holders of Doyle's estate will return fees they collected.

#### ID: 20000f5f Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The text tells us that because of the copyright, adapting Sherlock Holmes stories used to be expensive and difficult. This suggests that after the copyright ends, it will be less expensive and less difficult to adapt these stories.

Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text never suggests that the copyright ending will make Sherlock Holmes stories harder to find. Instead, it suggests that adaptations of these stories will be easier and less expensive to make. Choice B is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text never discusses people's interest in detective stories, so there is no basis to make this inference. Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text never suggests that copyright fees from the past are returned after a copyright ends, so there is no basis to make this inference.

One aspect of in-person shopping that online shopping can't replicate is the opportunity to touch a product before buying it. Does this difference matter? In an experiment, researchers asked one group of participants to touch a mug and a toy, while another group was prohibited from touching the two items. The participants were then asked how much money they'd pay for the items. People who got to touch the items were willing to pay much more money for them than were people who weren't allowed to touch the items. This finding suggests that

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. people who mainly shop online probably spend more money every month than people who mainly shop in person do.
- B. in-person shopping may make products seem more valuable than they seem if only viewed online.
- C. retailers with in-person and online stores should charge the same price for a given product in both places.
- D. online retailers may be able to raise they charge for products that are only available online.

#### ID: 6bc0e595 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The text tells us that "people who got to touch the items were willing to pay much more money for them than people who weren't allowed to touch" them. This suggests that being able to interact with a product in person may make it seem more valuable to a shopper.

Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn't discuss how much people spend each month, so there's not much basis for this claim. Furthermore, since being able to touch a product tends to make people "willing to pay much more money" for it, we might predict that an online shopper would be willing to spend less on the same purchases as an in-person shopper. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn't discuss what retailers "should charge," so there's not much basis for this claim. Furthermore, the study in the text suggests that in-person stores may actually be able to charge more for a given product, since shoppers can touch it. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn't discuss products that are only available online, so there's not much basis for this claim. Furthermore, products only available online would still have the problem of shoppers not being able to touch them, and the study suggests that this lowers the prices shoppers are willing to pay.

Archaeologists have been debating the origin of a rare form of lead found in Shang dynasty (1766–1046 BCE) bronze artifacts since its presence was discovered in China in the 1990s. Different researchers have proposed theories on which regions of the world would have had the raw materials containing the specific lead in these artifacts, but no conclusive evidence has been presented. What is intriguing is that bronze artifacts from China dated after the Shang dynasty do not contain this form of lead, suggesting that __

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. Shang dynasty bronze pieces are rare and therefore more valuable than those from other time periods.
- B. the source of some of the raw materials used to make bronze was exploited only until the Shang dynasty.
- C. bronze was used for a short time during the Shang dynasty before different metals were used to make artifacts.
- D. methods used to analyze bronze artifacts are not useful on pieces that are dated after the Shang dynasty.

#### ID: c4d43991 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The passage tells us that Shanq dynasty bronze artifacts contained "a rare form of lead," but that bronze artifacts after this time did not contain that lead. Although we don't know where that specific type of bronze came from, we can conclude that that source was not used after the Shanq dynasty-otherwise, post-Shanq dynasty pieces would also contain that rare form of lead.

Choice A is incorrect. Despite these pieces containing "a rare form of lead," there is no direct claim in the passage that Shang dynasty bronze is itself more rare or valuable than bronze pieces from other periods. Therefore, there's no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. Although the passage mentions that the nature of the bronze in Chinese artifacts changed after the Shang dynasty, bronze was still used to create artifacts after this time. The passage in fact explicitly states "bronze artifacts from China dated after the Shang dynasty..." indicating that bronze was still used in China after the Shang dynasty. Choice D is incorrect. There's no mention in the passage of methods used to analyze bronze artifacts, so there's no basis for this inference.

Off-off-Broadway theaters emerged in the late 1950s as a rebellion against mainstream Broadway theaters in New York, freeing artists to create productions that were more experimental than typical Broadway shows. One such artist was playwright María Irene Fornés. Working with off-off Broadway theaters enabled Fornés not only to direct her own plays but also to direct them exactly as she intended them to be staged, regardless of how strange the results might have seemed to audiences accustomed to Broadway shows. In this way, Fornés _

Which choice most logically completes the text?

A. wrote plays that would have been too expensive to produce if someone else had directed the production.

- B. recognized that staging an off-off-Broadway play was more complicated than staging a Broadway play.
- C. would have been more famous if she had created plays that were mainstream instead of experimental.
- D. illustrates the artistic opportunity offered by off-off Broadway theaters.

#### ID: dbbbc5dd Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The text says that off-off-Broadway theaters allowed artists to create more experimental shows, and then discusses how Fornés was free to direct her own "strange" plays however she wanted. This suggests that Fornés exemplifies the artistic freedom of off-off Broadway theaters.

Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text never discusses the costs of production, so we can't logically make this claim. Choice B is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text never discusses the complexity of staging plays either on Broadway or off-off Broadway, so there's no basis to make this inference. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text never discusses fame at all, so there's no basis to make this inference.

North American gray wolves usually have mixed gray and white fur, but some members of the species have a version of a gene, or gene variant, that gives them a mostly black coat instead. Sarah Cubaynes and her team studied twelve populations of North American gray wolves. They found that the black-furred wolves are more common in areas where outbreaks of distemper virus happen regularly. The team also discovered that the blackfurred wolves are more likely to be immune to distemper than the gray-furred wolves are. Taken together, these findings suggest that _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

B. the gene variant that results in black fur may be linked to immunity to the distemper virus.

C. the average life span of gray wolves is likely to increase over time because of a particular gene variant.

D. gray-furred wolves will soon replace black-furred wolves across North America.

ID: 8a3ecac6 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The text tells us that the black-furred wolves are more common in areas with regular outbreaks of distemper virus and are more likely to be immune to distemper than the gray-furred wolves. This suggests that the gene variant that results in black fur may be linked to immunity to the distemper virus.

Choice A is incorrect. The text never compares North American gray wolves to other wolf species—in fact, it never discusses other wolf species at all, so there's no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The life span of gray wolves is never mentioned in this text, so we have no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. This is too extreme. The text says that "black-furred wolves are more likely to be immune to distemper than the qray-furred wolves," but that alone doesn't mean that black-furred wolves will replace gray-furred wolves across North America.

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. lifelike handshakes may make people more comfortable interacting with robots.
- B. it's easier to program a robot to perform handshakes than it is to perform some other types of greetings.
- C. people are less likely to interact with robots that don't look like humans.
- D. the robot in the researchers' study may have uses other than interacting with humans.

### ID: 25893fc7 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The text says that handshakes create trust, and that the engineers' goal is to "improve human-robot interactions." This suggests that they want the robot's handshake to feel real because they want humans to trust the robot.

Choice B is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text never discusses any other types of greetings, so there is no basis to make this inference. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text never discusses the appearance of this robot or any other robots, so there is no basis to make this inference. Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text never discusses any uses for the robot other than interacting with humans, so there is no basis to make this inference.

Martin Dančák, Wewin Tjiasmanto, and colleagues have identified a new carnivorous plant species (Nepenthes pudica) in Indonesia. Like other carnivorous plants, N. pudica has pitfall traps, or pitchers, that capture prey, but unlike others, the pitchers of N. pudica are located underground. The researchers unearthed the new species on fairly dry ridges with surfaces that host few other plants and animals. Therefore, the researchers hypothesize that the N. pudica species likely ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- B. formed pitchers early in development to absorb more moisture.
- C. is buried by nearby animals as they forage along the ridges for food.
- D. evolved to have underground traps to access more prey than would surface traps.

## ID: 787729be Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The text says that N.pudica's prey-catching pitchers are underground. It also says that the ridges where N. pudicalives don't have many plants and animals on the surface. This suggests that N. pudica evolved underground pitchers in order to catch more prey.

Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text never mentions the possibility of other undiscovered carnivorous plant species in Indonesia, so there's no basis to make this inference. Choice B is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text does where N. pudicalives are dry, but it also says that the purpose of carnivorous plant pitchers is to capture prey. It never suggests that these pitchers also absorb moisture, so there's no basis to make this inference. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text never suggests that N. pudica's underground pitcher can catch animals on the surface, so there's no basis to make this inference.

In the South Pacific, New Caledonian crows use two different kinds of stick tools. One tool is complex. The crows shape a stick from a rare plant into a hook. The other tool is basic. The crows find a stick without a hook on the ground. The hooked tool is harder to get but is much better than the basic tool at removing prey from holes. When studying New Caledonian crows, ecologist Barbara Klump found that they hold the hooked tools in their claws when not using them, or they carefully put them in a safe place. The crows don't do the same with the basic tools. This suggests to Klump that the _

Which choice most logically completes the text?

A. hooked stick tools are more valuable to the crows than the stick tools without hooks.

B. hooked stick tools are easier for most of the crows to hold than the stick tools without hooks.

C. crows prefer to share their hooked stick tools but don't share the stick tools without hooks.

D. crows realize that both kinds of stick tools are less effective than their claws are at removing prey from holes.

ID: 493c46bc Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer because it most loqically completes the text's discussion of the two types of stick tools used by New Caledonian crows. The text indicates that the more effective type of tool has a hook that the crows make themselves, while the other type of tool is simply a stick without a hook that the crows find and don't shape in any way. According to the text, Klump found that the crows keep hooked tools-but not the tools without hooks-in their grasp or in safe places when they aren't using the tools. If the hooked tools are more effective than the tools without hooks are and the crows are more protective of the hooked tools than they are of the tools without hooks, it's reasonable to conclude that the hooked tools are more valuable to the crows than the tools without hooks are.

Choice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication of how easy it is for the crows to hold either the hooked tools or the tools without hooks. The text does state that crows hold the hooked tools and not the tools without hooks when the tools aren't in use. However, the text also indicates that the hooked tools require work from the crows to make and are more useful for helping the crows catch prey than the tools without hooks are. This context suggests that the crows hold the hooked tools because they're more valuable to the crows than the tools without hooks are, not because the hooked tools are easier to hold. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the crows sharing tools. Additionally, the text indicates that when the crows aren't using the hooked tools, they either grasp the tools or store them safely, which suqqests that the crows try to maintain possession of the hooked tools, not that crows prefer to share those tools. Choice D is incorrect because the text says nothing about the crows using their claws to remove prey from holes, so there's no evidence that the crows perceive the stick tools to be less effective than their claws are.

Georgia Douglas Johnson wrote many plays in the 1920s and 1930s. At the time, professional theater companies rarely put on plays by Black women, so few of Johnson's plays made it to the stage. Only a small number of her plays were published in her lifetime. But that doesn't mean that Johnson never learned what other people thought of her plays. Johnson hosted weekly get-togethers for fellow Black writers and artists in her Washington, D.C., home. Attendees would read and discuss one another's work, including Johnson's own. These gatherings could therefore serve as __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Which choice most logically completes the text?

A. an occasion for professional theater companies to put on plays.

- B. an opportunity for Johnson to get feedback on her plays.
- C. a way for Johnson to learn about plays that were produced in other cities.
- D. subject matter for future plays by Johnson.

ID: 7a895def Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The passage tells us that attendees at Johnson's get-togethers "would read and discuss one another's work." This suggests that the gatherings could provide an opportunity for Johnson to get feedback on her plays. Notice how the text foreshadows this conclusion by the mention of Johnson learning "what other people thought of her plays."

Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention theater companies attending the get-togethers, so there is no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention learning about plays from other cities, so there is no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention Johnson using the qet-togethers as inspiration for future plays, so there is no basis for this inference.

Alice Guy-Blaché directed hundreds of films between 1896 and 1920. She wanted audiences to feel like they were watching real people on screen. She would encourage actors in her films to behave naturally. Guy-Blaché even hung a large sign reading "Be Natural" in the studio where she made her films lacked sound, so actors needed to rely solely on their bodies and facial expressions to convey emotions. As a result, actors tended to highly exaggerate their actions and expressions. The style of acting in Guy-Blaché's films was therefore

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. copied by many of Guy-Blaché's peers.
- B. familiar to actors who had worked on other directors' films.
- C. very unusual for the period.
- D. better than film acting today.

ID: 9077be25 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The text tells us that "actors tended to highly exaggerate their actions and expressions" in films produced from 1896 to 1920. This suggests that the natural style of acting in Guy-Blaché's films was very unusual for the time.

Choice A is incorrect. The text never discusses any other directors copying the style of acting found in Guy-Blaché's films, and in fact suggests the opposite-that it was unusual for directors to suggest this style of acting at the time. Choice B is incorrect. The text never discusses actors' familiarity with the style of acting found in Guy-Blaché's films, so there isn't much basis for this inference. But since the text tells us that other films of the period used a highly exaggerated form of acting, we might predict that the natural style in Guy-Blachés films would have been unfamiliar to these actors. Choice D is incorrect. The text never discusses film acting today, so there's no basis for this inference.

To create the poems in her 2017 collection One Last Word, poet Nikki Grimes used a writing method called the golden shovel. This method often involves choosing a line from an existing poem and then using each word from that line as the last word of each line in a new poem. Grimes wanted the poems in One Last Word to honor important Black poets of the past, so she chose lines by poets such as Langston Hughes and Georgia Douglas Johnson. Writing in this way can be challenging and might seem as though it would produce awkward poems. However, reviewers praised One Last Word as a beautiful and powerful tribute to the poets who inspired it. This reaction suggests that __

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. most reviewers didn't understand Grimes's goal for One Last Word.
- B. Grimes successfully used the golden shovel method to achieve her goal for One Last Word.
- C. Langston Hughes and Georgia Douglas Johnson are two of Grimes's favorite poets.
- D. Grimes inspired many other writers to create poems using the golden shovel method.

#### ID: 1d0b5bf4 Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Nikki Grimes's poety collection One Last Word. The text explains that Grimes used a writing method called the golden shovel to create the poems in her book. According to the text, the method involves basing a new poem on a line from an existing poem. The text then mentions Langston Hughes and Georgia Douglas Johnson as examples of important Black poets whose lines of poetry form the basis of Grimes's poems. The text goes on to say that this writing method is difficult and that the resulting poems can be awkward, but reviewers have positively reviewed Grimes's book. If the reviewers of One Last Word specifically note that the work is a "beautiful and powerful tribute to the poets who inspired it," then they must have appreciated how Grimes used the golden shovel method to pay tribute to other poets. This suggests that Grimes was successful in using the golden shovel method to achieve her goal of honoring Black poets in her book.

Choice A is incorrect because the reaction suggests that most reviewers did understand Grimes's qoal for her book. According to the text, the reviewers noted that the poems in her book were a "beautiful and powerful tribute to the poets who inspired it." Earlier, the text claims that Grimes intended the poems "to honor important Black poets of the past," so in their praise of her book, the reviewers clearly indicated that they understood Grimes's goal. Choice C is incorrect. Although it's likely that Grimes sought to honor Hughes and Johnson in her book of poetry because they're among her favorite poets, this fact isn't suggested by the reviewers' positive reaction to her book.

Researchers wanted to study how consumers' reactions to an ad may be affected by other ads. The researchers began by showing study participants an ad for a product, with some seeing a less detailed ad and others seeing a more detailed one. Then, all participants viewed the same second ad for a store and shared their opinion of the store based on this second ad. Participants who had first seen an ad less detailed than the second ad had a higher opinion of the store than the participants who had first seen a more detailed ad.

- B. the length of time viewing previous ads.

### ID: 5b4829d2 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The passage tells us that participants who had seen a less detailed ad for a product beforehand had a higher opinion of the store than those who had seen a more detailed ad. This suggests that reactions to an ad may be affected by the amount of detail viewed in previous ads.

Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention the number of people who viewed the ad, so there's no basis for this inference. Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention the length of time viewing previous ads, so there's no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention the time of day that the ad is viewed, so there's no basis for this inference.
