2.1

In her 2021 article "Throwaway History: Towards a Historiography of Ephemera," scholar Anne Garner discusses John Johnson (1882–1956), a devoted collector of items intended to be discarded, including bus tickets and campaign pamphlets. Johnson recognized that scholarly institutions considered his expansive collection of ephemera to be worthless—indeed, it wasn't until 1968, after Johnson's death, that Oxford University's Bodleian Library acquired the collection, having grasped the items' potential value to historians and other researchers. Hence, the example of Johnson serves to _

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. demonstrate the difficulties faced by contemporary historians in conducting research at the Bodleian Library without access to ephemera.
- B. represent the challenge of incorporating examples of ephemera into the collections of libraries and other scholarly institutions.
- C. lend support to arguments by historians and other researchers who continue to assert that ephemera holds no value for scholars.
- D. illustrate both the relatively low scholarly regard in which ephemera was once held and the later recognition of ephemera's possible utility.

### ID: d748c3fd Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. Johnson collected "ephemera," or things that are meant to be thrown away. Scholars thought his collection was worthless to them, then later realized that it was potentially valuable. This suggests that scholars went from disregarding ephemera to recognizing their usefulness.

Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text tells us that the Bodleian Library acquired Johnson's large collection of ephemera back in 1968, so we can assume that contemporary historians conducting research there do have access to that collection. Choice B is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text tells us that "Oxford University's Bodleian Library acquired the collection," but it never suggests that it was a challenge to do so. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text actually suggests the opposite: the example of Johnson's collection lends support to arguments that ephemera does hold value for scholars.

Some businesses believe that when employees are interrupted while doing their work, they experience a decrease in energy and productivity. However, a team led by Harshad Puranik, who studies management, has found that interruptions by colleagues can have a social component that increases employees' sense of belonging, resulting in greater job satisfaction that benefits employers. Therefore, businesses should recognize that

Which choice most logically completes the text?

A. the interpersonal benefits of some interruptions in the workplace may offset the perceived negative effects.

- B. in order to maximize productivity, employers should be willing to interrupt employees frequently throughout the day.
- C. most employees avoid interrupting colleagues they don't appreciate being interrupted themselves.
- D. in order to cultivate an ideal workplace environment, interruptions of work should be discouraged.

### ID: 3190835d Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of potential benefits of interruptions in the workplace. The text indicates that a common belief in business is that interruptions to working employees decrease energy and productivity levels. However, the text goes on to explain that a research team led by Harshad Puranik has found that there could be a social benefit to these interruptions. Since the team found that workplace interruptions can increase employees' sense of belonging and job satisfaction, it follows that the interpersonal benefits of some interruptions can offset the perceived negative effects.

Choice B is incorrect. Although the text presents research findings that suggest some workplace interruptions can have a positive effect on employee job satisfaction, no further information is presented to suggest at what frequency these interruptions are ideal. Furthermore, the text doesn't tie workplace interruptions to increased productivity, but rather links it to social benefits such as sense of belonging. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't address employees' motives for choosing not to interrupt their colleagues. The text presents research findings that suggest that there are some positive interpersonal effects of workplace interruptions that can increase employee job satisfaction. Choice D is incorrect because asking businesses to discourage workplace interruptions doesn't follow from the team's research about the benefits of workplace interruptions, nor does the text describe an ideal work environment. Instead, the text presents research suggesting that there may be positive aspects to workplace interruptions that haven't previously been considered.

2.3

Songbirds learn to respond to and imitate their species' songs from an early age. With each generation, small differences are introduced that result in distinct variations-called dialects-among geographically isolated populations of the same species. A research study examined whether twelve-day-old Ficedula hypoleuca (pied flycatcher) nestlings prefer local dialects over the unfamiliar dialects of nonlocal F. hypoleuca populations: the more begging calls the nestlings made in response to a song, the stronger their preference. The researchers found that nestlings produced more begging calls in response to their own dialect than to nonlocal dialects. Since song preference plays a role in songbird mate selection, the finding suggests that__

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. F. hypoleuca nestlings' preference for their own dialect likely disappears as they mature to promote socialization between different F. hypoleuca populations.
- B. F. hypoleuca nestlings who show an early preference for their own dialect are likely to receive more food from their caretakers than nestlings who show no preferences among any F. hypoleuca dialects.
- C. F. hypoleuca nestlings' preference for their own dialect likely drives them when they mature to reproduce with other F. hypoleuca from local rather than nonlocal populations.
- D. F. hypoleuca nestlings show a preference for both local F. hypoleuca dialects and the songs of other local songbirds over the songs of nonlocal birds of any species.

#### ID: db876fd5 Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. Because "song preference plays a role in songbird mate selection," and because F. hypoleuca nestlings display a preference for local dialects, we can infer that they will be more likely to choose mates from local populations.

Choice A is incorrect. We don't have any information suggesting that this preference disappears, so there's no basis for this inference. Choice B is incorrect. Although the passage discusses the number of begging calls made in response to various F. hypoleuca dialects, no mention is made about the amount of food received based on dialect preference. There's no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. There's no mention in the passage of methods of other types of local songbirds, so there's no basis for this inference.

Dutch painters in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries often showed tables filled with large wheels of cheese or carved shards of butter. Some art historians, noting that dairy products were a major component of the Dutch diet, interpret these depictions as reflections of everyday Dutch eating habits. However, a group of researchers recently reviewed hundreds of food-related paintings and found that lemons—which could only be acquired in the Netherlands at great cost, since they had to be imported from warmer climates—feature in Dutch paintings of the period more than three times as frequently as dairy products do, thereby casting doubt on the idea that _

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. dairy products were a more significant component of the Dutch diet of the period than lemons were.
- B. food was a more popular subject among Dutch painters than it was among painters from other countries at the time.
- C. depictions of food in Dutch paintings of the period should be taken as realistic representations of Dutch eating habits.
- D. Dutch painters of the period may have depicted foods for symbolic reasons rather than to show what Dutch people typically ate.

#### ID: 55688b3c Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The text tells us that lemons—an expensive imported product—feature in Dutch paintings of the period more frequently than dairy products do. Since it's unlikely lemons were eaten more often than dairy, this fact casts doubt on the theory that these paintings realistically depicted Dutch diets.

Choice A is incorrect. In fact, the text suggests the opposite: it says that dairy products were a "major component of the Dutch diet," while lemons were an expensive import item, so we can infer that lemons were eaten much more rarely than dairy products. Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention painters from other countries, so there's no basis to make this inference. Choice D is incorrect. In fact, the text suggests that Dutch painters do have reasons for depicting foods other than to show what Dutch people typically ate. For example, lemons in a painting could indicate wealth or prosperity.

When the Vinland Map, a map of the world purported to date to the mid-1400s, surfaced in 1957, some scholars believed it demonstrated that European knowledge of the eastern coast of present-day North America predated Christopher Columbus's 1492 arrival. In 2021, a team including conservators Marie-France Lemay and Paula Zyats and materials scientist Anikó Bezur performed an extensive analysis of the map and the ink used. They found that the ink contains titanium dioxide, a compound that was first introduced in ink manufacturing in the early 1900s. Therefore, the team concluded that __

Which choice most logically completes the text?

A. mid-1400s Europeans could not have known about the eastern coast of present-day North America.

- B. the Vinland Map could not have been drawn by mid-1400s mapmakers.
- C. mapmakers must have used titanium compounds in their ink in the 1400s.
- D. there isn't enough information to determine when the ink was created.

ID: 8fbed1cb Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur's 2021 analysis of the Vinland Map. The text indicates that while some scholars have believed that the map was drawn in the mid-1400s, the 2021 analysis showed the presence of the compound titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the map. The text goes on to say that titanium dioxide wasn't used to manufacture ink until the early 1900s, which means that ink containing this compound couldn't have been available to mapmakers in the 1400s. Since mapmakers in the mid-1400s couldn't have used ink with titanium dioxide, it follows that the Vinland Map couldn't have been drawn by mid-1400s mapmakers.

Choice A is incorrect because the 2021 finding that the ink used to draw the Vinland Map wasn't available until the early 1900s doesn't imply that Europeans in the mid-1400s couldn't have known about the eastern coast of North America. While this finding suggests that the map couldn't have been created in the mid-1400s, it doesn't preclude the possibility that Europeans nevertheless had knowledge-and perhaps even drew other maps that are no longer in existence or are yet to be discovered by researchers—of the eastern coast of present-day North America as early as the mid-1400s. Choice C is incorrect because there's nothing in the text that suggests that the 2021 discovery of the presence of titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the Vinland Map caused Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur to question or reach a new conclusion about when mapmakers began using ink containing titanium compounds. Instead, the text indicates that titanium dioxide wasn't used in ink before the early 1900s. This knowledge led the team to conclude that the map, which was drawn with ink containing titanium dioxide, couldn't have been created in the mid-1400s. Choice D is incorrect because although the text doesn't indicate that Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur established an exact date for the creation of

{5}------------------------------------------------

the ink that was used to draw the Vinland Map, the text does say that titanium dioxide was introduced in ink manufacturing in the early 1900s. This fact provides enough information to determine that the ink that was used to draw the map was created no earlier than the early 1900s. This finding, in turn, led the team to conclude that the Vinland Map couldn't have been drawn in the mid-1400s.

It's common for jazz musicians and fans to refer to certain songs as having "swing," indicating that the songs provoke a strong feeling, like the impulse to tap one's foot or dance. The exact acoustic properties that give a song swing, however, have long been thought to be undefinable. To investigate swing, a team led by physicist Corentin Nelias delayed the downbeats and synchronized the offbeats in jazz piano solos and asked jazz musicians to compare the intensity of swing in each modified piece with the intensity of swing in the original piece. They found that participants were more than seven times likelier to characterize the modified songs as having swing than to characterize the original versions as having swing, suggesting that _

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. synchronized offbeats tend to give a song swing regardless of whether downbeats are delayed.
- B. the acoustic properties that give a song swing are not easy for jazz musicians to manipulate.
- C. jazz songs that feature the piano are more likely to have swing than are jazz songs that do not feature the piano.
- D. the timing of downbeats and offbeats may play a crucial role in giving a song swing.

#### ID: 5432d1de Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The passage tells us that participants were "more than seven times likelier to characterize the modified songs as having swing than to characterize the original versions as having swing." Because the modified songs had been changed by altering the downbeats and offbeats, this suggests that the timing of downbeats and offbeats may play a crucial role in giving a song swing.

Choice A is incorrect. Although the passage mentions that the researchers "synchronized the offbeats" in the modified songs, they also "delayed the downbeats" in those songs. Because we can't disentangle whether it was the synchronized offbeats, the delayed downbeats, or the combination of both that increased the song's swing, we don't have enough information to make this inference. Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention whether or not it's difficult for a jazz musician to give a song swing, so there's no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn't compare jazz songs that feature piano to those that don't, so there's no basis for this inference.

The Indus River valley civilization flourished in South Asia from 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE. Many examples of the civilization's writing system exist, but researchers haven't yet deciphered it or identified which ancient language it represents. Nevertheless, archaeologists have found historical artifacts, such as clay figures and jewelry, that provide information about the civilization's customs and how its communities were organized. The archaeologists' findings therefore suggest that __

Which choice most logically completes the text?

A. investigating an ancient civilization is easier without knowledge of the civilization's language.

- B. knowing an ancient civilization's language isn't necessary in order to learn details about the civilization.
- C. archaeological research should focus on finding additional artifacts rather than deciphering ancient languages.
- D. examining the civilization's historical artifacts has resolved this civilization's language.

#### ID: 4e9afd7a Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the Indus River valley civilization. The text establishes that archaeologists haven't been able to interpret the Indus River valley civilization's writing system but have nevertheless acquired information about the civilization through historical artifacts. The fact that archaeologists have been about the Indus River valley civilization's customs and community organization from historical artifacts suggests that it isn't necessary to understand an ancient civilization's language to learn about the civilization.

Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't discuss how easy it is to investigate ancient civilizations with or without knowledge of the civilization's language; rather, it states that even though researchers have not yet deciphered the language of the Indus River valley civilization, they are still able to learn about it through historical artifacts. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't make any claims as to what the focus of archaeological research should be. Rather, the text discusses how archaeologists have been about an ancient civilization through historical artifacts despite not understanding the civilization's language. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that the civilization's language has not yet been interpreted; it makes no mention of a debate about the language. Instead, the text suggests that examination of the historical artifacts has allowed archaeologists to learn about the civilization but has not aided thus far in deciphering its language.

To investigate the history of plate subduction-when one of Earth's tectonic plates slides beneath another—Sarah M. Aarons and colleagues compared ancient rocks from the Acasta Gneiss Complex in Canada to modern rocks. Using isotope analysis, the researchers found that Acasta rocks dating to about 4.02 billion years ago (bya) most strongly resemble modern rocks formed in a plume setting (an area in which hot rocks from Earth's mantle flow upward into the crust). By contrast, they found that Acasta rocks dating to about 3.75 bya and 3.6 bya have an isotope composition that is similar to that of modern rocks formed in a subduction setting. Aarons's team therefore concluded that ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Which choice most logically completes the text?

A. subduction-like processes began occurring in some locations no later than 3.75 bya.

B. subduction replaced mantle plume formation as the most common geological process by about 4.02 bya.

C. the majority of the rocks in the Acasta Gneiss Complex formed through subduction.

D. the rocks in the Acasta Gneiss Complex are of a more recent origin than scientists previously thought.

#### ID: 3882ddf6 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. Because researchers found "Acasta rocks dating to about 3.75 bya" were similar to "modern rocks formed in a subduction setting," we can infer that subduction-like processes must have begun occurring in the Acasta Gneiss Complex by this time.

Choice B is incorrect. We only know about geological processes at the Acasta Gneiss Complex, so we do not have information to make inferences about geological processes in general. Also, notice that the rocks dated to 4.02 bya were found to still be formed in a plume setting, so the transition must have happened after this time. Choice C is incorrect. There's no mention in the passage of what proportion of the rocks within Acasta Gneiss Complex were formed through subduction, so there's no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. The passage discusses various rocks in the Acasta Gneiss Complex that are dated to different periods of time, but nothing in the passage suggests that these dates are or were wrong.

The Haitian Declaration of Independence was issued in 1804, bringing to an end the revolution against colonial France that began in 1791. Written in French, which was not the first language of most Haitians but which was used throughout Europe as the language of international diplomacy, the declaration notes that Haiti will not bring rebellion to other Caribbean nations, promises to respect the sovereignty of its neighbors—widely understood as a reassurance to the United States—and sets up Haiti as an example for future struggles against colonizers (an implicit reference to the many colonies then found in the Americas). So even though the declaration is explicitly addressed to the Haitian people, it's reasonable to conclude that ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________

A. aspects of the declaration were modeled on similar documents from other countries.

- B. the French government may have been surprised by the declaration.
- C. many Haitian people opposed the revolution and the declaration.
- D. the declaration actually had several intended audiences.

#### ID: 350e2336 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The passage tells us that the declaration was written in a language important to European diplomacy but not most Haitians, states that the declaration included "a reassurance to the United States," and made implicit references to colonies in the Americas. Because of the messages within the declaration that were largely irrelevant to the Haitian people, we can assume that the Haitian people were not the only audience for this document.

Choice A is incorrect. There's no mention in the passage of similar documents in other countries, so there's no basis for this inference. Choice B is incorrect. Although there's an implicit reference to European governments when the passage discusses how the declaration was written in French, "which was used throughout Europe as the language of international diplomacy," there is no discussion of the French government's response to the declaration. There's no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention the popularity of the revolution and declaration among the Haitian people, so there's no basis for this inference.

By running computer simulations of the development of our solar system, André Izidoro, Rajdeep Dasgupta, and colleagues concluded that the Sun may have been surrounded by three giant dust rings before the planets started to form. The researchers suggest that the materials in the innermost ring became the four planets closest to the Sun, the materials in the middle ring produced the rest of the materials in the outermost ring created the asteroids and other small bodies in the region beyond Neptune. In one simulation, the researchers delayed the initial formation of the middle ring, causing oversized super-Earths to begin developing from the innermost ring.

- D. the innermost ring actually formed in our solar system, not just the four closest to the Sun.

## ID: 575e67df Answer

Correct Answer: B

## Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically follows from the text's discussion of Andre Izidoro, Rajdeep Dasqupta, and colleagues' computer simulations of our solar system's development. The text begins by stating that the simulations led the researchers to conclude that the solar system likely formed from three giant dust rings that encircled the Sun. The text explains that the four inner planets, including Earth, formed from the innermost ring and that the remaining planets formed from the middle ring. It then explains that in one simulation, the researchers delayed the formation of the middle ring—that is, they tested to see what would happen if the middle ring had formed later than it actually did. They found that doing so affected the size of the innermost planets, resulting in oversized super-Earths, planets that are much larger than Earth. Since the delayed timing had the effect of chanqing the size of Earth in the simulation relative to Earth's real size, it's reasonable to conclude that the timing of the middle ring's formation was important in determining Earth's eventual size.

Choice A is incorrect. Although the text explains that when the researchers delayed the formation of the middle ring in one simulation, the size of the innermost planets was affected (which suggests that the middle rinq likely formed earlier than it did in this simulation), the text doesn't indicate that this was an initial simulation—that is, a simulation that was conducted before other simulations. Moreover, the text makes no reference to the specific results of any other simulations; there is no basis for comparing any

{11}------------------------------------------------

conclusions based on the simulation in which the middle ring's formation was delayed with conclusions based on other simulations. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses how altering the timing of the formation of the middle ring, not the outermost ring, affected the four innermost planets' eventual size in the researchers' simulation; therefore, the simulation offers no basis for a conclusion about how the outermost ring's formation affected the size of the planets. Choice D is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that the innermost ring produced all the solar system's planets. Rather, the text states that the simulations showed that the innermost planets formed from the innermost ring and that the remaining planets formed from the middle ring.

Astronomers investigated the Arabia Terra region of Mars because it appears to contain irregularly shaped craters that may have been caused by massive volcanc explosions. In their investigations of Arabia Terra, the researchers found remnants of ash deposits in an amount and thickness that would result from a massive volcanic eruption. However, erosion and past resurfacing events could have modified the surface of the planet. Therefore, __

Which choice most logically completes the text?

A. the current makeup of the Arabia Terra region might not accurately reflect the volcanic activity of Mars's past.

B. eruptions from Mars's volcanoes were likely not as massive as astronomers previously believed.

- C. ash was most likely expelled from multiple different volcanoes on Mars's surface.
D. the craters found in the Arabia Terra region were necessarily created by events other than volcanic eruptions.

## ID: 485962a6 Answer

Correct Answer: A

## Rationale

Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text's discussion of the Arabia Terra region of Mars. According to the text, there are craters in Arabia Terra that could be the result of volcanic activity, and researchers have found evidence of ash deposits consistent with a large eruption. The text qoes on to note, however, that erosion and other events could have altered the surface of Mars. This observation suggests that current conditions on Mars's surface are not necessarily a reliable guide to past events-some signs of past events could have been transformed or erased entirely-and thus the current makeup of Arabia Terra may not accurately reflect past volcanic activity.

Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests only that past events could have changed Mars's surface such that its current appearance isn't a reliable guide to past activity, not that it's likely that past eruptions were not as massive as astronomers previously believed. Nothing in the text supports a conclusion about the likely size of past eruptions. Choice C is incorrect because the observation that resurfacing events could have changed the appearance of Mars doesn't imply that the ash discussed in the text likely came from multiple volcanoes. Although it's possible that the ash came from different volcanoes, there's no information in the text supporting a conclusion about how likely that possibility is. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suqgests that the Arabia Terra craters had to have been created by something other than volcanic eruptions. Although the text does suggest that the evidence consistent with volcanic eruptions shouldn't be taken as definitive proof of past eruptions, that doesn't mean that the craters couldn't have been created by eruptions, only that we can't be certain they were.

## ID: 299c5303 Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. Dramaturges help playwrights with storytelling and characterization. Choreographers often tell stories through dance, so they are also concerned with storytelling and characterization. This suggests that the fact that choreographers seek the help of dramaturges with the storytelling aspects of their dances should be "unsurprising."

Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The beginning of the text does imply that this is true, but the end is leading to a conclusion about how choreographers use dramaturges. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text never mentions dances by choreographers who don't incorporate narrative elements. Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text mentions in passing that directors use dramaturges to conduct research, but it never suggests that directors and actors are too reliant on them. Also, the text is leading to a conclusion about how choreographers use dramaturges.

Ana Castillo's 1986 novel The Mixquiahuala Letters is a story told entirely through expressive letters from the narrator to her friend—letters that Castillo suggests could be read in several different orders. As they began reading it in class, some students remarked that they found the novel's letter format daunting and its treatment of gender relations old-fashioned. The professor, however, pointed out that the novel is written in modern-sounding language and addresses issues that still matter today, suggesting that The Mixquiahuala Letters _____________________________________________________________________________

Which choice most logically completes the text?

A. has more to say about gender relations than other novels from the same period.

- B. is more relevant to contemporary audiences than it may seem at first.
- C. is easier to read than many contemporary novels that focus on friendship.
- D. is best understood after multiple readings in different orders.

## ID: bcf2f169 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Ana Castillo's 1986 novel The Mixquiahuala Letters. The text states that the novel consists entirely of letters from the narrator to her friend-a format that some students reading the novel in a class found intimidating. According to the text, those students also found the novel's treatment of gender to be old-fashioned. In response to the students' concerns, their professor emphasized the novel's relevance: it's written in modern-sounding language and addresses issues that still matter. This, in turn, suggests that The Mixquiahuala Letters is more relevant to contemporary audiences than it may initially seem.

Choice A is incorrect because the professor's response to the students only mentions The Mixquiahuala Letters it doesn't compare the novel to others from the same period. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the professor's response to the students compares The Mixquiahuala Letters to contemporary novels about friendship. Choice D is incorrect because the professor's response to the students doesn't address the idea of reading the novel's letters multiple times and in different orders.

Biologist Natacha Bodenhausen and colleagues analyzed the naturally occurring bacterial communities associated with leaves and roots of wild Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flowering plant. The researchers found many of the same bacterial genera in both the plants' leaves and roots. To explain this, the researchers pointed to the general proximity of A. thaliana leaves to the ground and noted that rain splashing off soil could bring soil-based bacteria into contact with the leaves. Alternatively, the researchers noted that wind, which may be a source of bacteria in the aboveground portion of plants, could also bring bacteria to the soil and roots. Either explanation suggests that ________

Which choice most logically completes the text?

A. bacteria carried by wind are typically less beneficial to A. thaliana than soil-based bacteria are.

B. some bacteria in A. thaliana leaves and roots may share a common source.

C. many bacteria in A. thaliana leaves may have been deposited by means other than rain.

- D. A. thaliana leaves and roots are especially vulnerable to harmful bacteria.
ID: cac82f9b Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. Both explanations suggest that the bacteria come from the same place: either they come from the ground and make their way to the leaves, or they come from above the ground and make their way to the roots.

Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text never discusses any benefits of any kind of bacteria. Choice C is incorrect. This conflicts with the text. One of the theories is that the bacteria in the leaves were deposited by rain splashing off soil. Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text only discusses "naturally occurring" bacteria. It never mentions either the harms or benefits of these bacteria.

Zines are small-scale, self-printed magazines. They have been around since the Black literary zine Fire!! was created in the 1920s. Since then, zines have appealed to creators looking for an inexpensive form of expression to share with a select audience. Zine creators often mix art with social commentary and challenge mainstream culture. At first, the internet appeared to replace the zine, but this old form persists. Today, there are enough zines in the United States to support annual zine festivals. This suggests that __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. creators can reach a larger audience by posting online.
- B. zines are still a meaningful form of expression.
- C. creators can continue to explore new art forms.
- D. zines are good sources of mainstream culture.

## ID: df654a2b Answer

#### Correct Answer: B

## Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically follows from the text's point about zines today. The text describes zines as a form of expression that goes back to the 1920s and asserts that "this old form persists." The text then indicates that multiple zines exist in the US today and that they are popular enough to support annual festivals, a point that suggests that people continue to view zines as a meaningful form of expression.

Choice A is incorrect because the text's point about current interest in the US doesn't logically suggest that zine creators can reach a larger audience by posting online. The text indicates that zines have long had an audience, and there's no indication that online posts have caused that audience to grow; there's no mention of zine creators' use of the internet at all. Choice C is incorrect because the idea that zine creators can explore new art forms-while objectively true-isn't logically connected to the text's discussion of zines as an existing form of expression (one that often includes art) or the point that zines are still popular enough in the US to support annual festivals. Choice D is incorrect because the point that zines are popular enough in the US today to support annual festivals doesn't logically suggest that zines present mainstream culture (or are themselves mainstream); moreover, the text states often "challenge mainstream culture."

Marine archaeologists have found much of the wooden hull of a sixteenth-century ship in a flooded quarry in southeast England. When it is exposed to air and water, wood rots quickly unless it is protected by sediment that shields it from oxygen. Therefore, the discovered ship was likely _

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. covered by a protective sediment layer in the quarry.
- B. one of several other ships buried in the same quarry.
- C. a confirmation of previous theories about the type of wood that was used in sixteenth-century ships.
- D. first constructed much earlier than previously thought.

## ID: 25fc2534 Answer

#### Correct Answer: A

## Rationale

Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the discovered ship. The text states that much of the ship's wooden hull was found in a quarry. The text also states that wood rots quickly unless it is protected by sediment, which shields the wood from exposure to oxygen. It is therefore reasonable to infer that the surviving portion of the ship's hull was covered by an oxygen-shielding layer of sediment.

Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests other ships have been or are likely to be found in the same quarry. The fact that much of this ship's wood survived for centuries in the possibility that there might be other preserved ships, but the text provides no support for such a conclusion. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not address the type of wood used in sixteenth-century ships or any theories pertaining to wood choice in ships. Choice D is incorrect because the text states only that the ship is from the sixteenth century, with no other dates offered for its construction, and thus there is no basis to consider alternative ages for the ship. Additionally, even if the ship was constructed earlier, it is not logically connected to the text's discussion of how it was preserved.

Parthenogenesis is a form of reproduction in which a female reproduces without mating. She produces an egg containing a single offspring whose DNA, or genetic material, comes entirely from its mother. Among birds, parthenogenesis has been found in a handful of species, including pigeons and turkeys. When scientists at the San Diego Zoo analyzed the DNA of the zoo's California condors (a species of vulture), they discovered that two individuals weren't genetically similar enough to any of the males in the condor enclosure to be their offspring. However, both had hatched from eggs laid by females in the enclosure. Thus, the scientists concluded that _

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. at least one of those individuals' mothers was born as a result of parthenogenesis.
- B. California condors may reproduce through parthenogenesis in zoos but not in the wild.
- C. the mothers of the two individuals probably reproduced through parthenogenesis.
- D. California condors reproduce through parthenogenesis only if females lack sufficient access to males.

## ID: 3d505895 Answer

## Correct Answer: C

## Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of parthenogenesis as it relates to two California condors at the San Diego Zoo. The text explains that parthenogenesis is a form of reproduction in which a female reproduces without mating, producing an egg containing an offspring with DNA that comes entirely from its mother. After noting examples of parthenogenesis among birds, the text then reports on a discovery at the San Diego Zoo. According to the text, scientists at the zoo found that two of the zoo's weren't similar enough to any of the zoo's male condors to be their offspring. Given that parthenoqenesis occurs without mating and results in an offspring with DNA entirely from its mother, it can reasonably be inferred that the scientists concluded that the mothers of the two condors probably didn't mate with any of the male condors at the zoo, reproducing through parthenogenesis instead.

Choice A is incorrect because the text never suggests that at least one of the condors' mothers was born as a result of parthenogenesis. Rather, the text suggests that the two condors were themselves both probably born as a result of parthenogenesis, which would account for their lack of strong genetic resemblance to any of the male condors in the zoo's condor enclosure. Choice B is incorrect because the text never discusses wild California condors living at the San Diego Zoo. For this reason, the text doesn't support a conclusion that distinguishes between how California condors reproduce in zoos and how they reproduce in the wild. Choice D is incorrect because the text never suggests that the zoo's female condors lacked sufficient access to males or that this would be a cause of parthenogenesis, indicating only that the condor enclosure included males.
