3.1

The most recent iteration of the immersive theater experience Sleep No More, which premiered in New York City in 2011, transforms its performance space—a five-story warehouse—into a 1930s-era hotel. Audience members, who wander through the labyrinthine venue at their own pace and follow the actors as they play out simultaneous, interweaving narrative loops, confront the impossibility of experiencing the production in its entirety. The play's refusal of narrative coherence thus hinges on the sense of spatial fragmentation that the venue's immense and intricate layout generates.

What does the text most strongly suggest about Sleep No More's use of its performance space?

- A. The choice of a New York City venue likely enabled the play's creators to experiment with the use of theatrical space in a way that venues from earlier productions could not.
- B. Audience members likely find the experience of the play disappointing because they generally cannot make their way through the entire venue.
- C. The production's dependence on a particular performance environment would likely make it difficult to reproduce exactly in a different theatrical space.
- D. Audience members who navigate the space according to a recommended itinerary will likely have a better grasp of the play's narrative than audience members who depart from that itinerary.

### ID: ed314256 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The text says that the production's use of its large, winding space has a very specific effect on the audience. Given that the space itself is so important to creating this effect, it would be difficult to reproduce the production in a different space.

Choice A is incorrect. The fact that the venue is in New York City isn't connected to the experimental nature of the performance. It's the size of the venue, not its location in New York, that affects the theatrical experience. Choice B is incorrect. The text never suggests that audience members are disappointed because they can't see the entire production. In fact, it suggests that that's an important part of the experience. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn't mention a recommended itinerary for audience members.

3.2

The following text is adapted from María Cristina Mena's 1914 short story "The Vine-Leaf."

It is a saying in the capital of Mexico that Dr. Malsufrido carries more family secrets under his hat than any archbishop.

The doctor's hat is, appropriately enough, uncommonly capacious, rising very high, and sinking so low that it seems to be supported by his ears and eyebrows, and it has a furry look, as if it had been brushed the wrong way, which is perhaps what happens to it if it is ever brushed at all. When the doctor takes it off, the family secrets do not fly out like a flock of parrots, but remain nicely bottled up beneath a dome of old and highly polished ivory.

Based on the text, how do people in the capital of Mexico most likely regard Dr. Malsufrido?

- A. Many have come to tolerate him despite his disheveled appearance.
- B. Few feel concerned that he will divulge their confidences.
- C. Some dislike how freely he discusses his own family.
- D. Most would be unimpressed by him were it not for his professional expertise.

### ID: 1a2b29c9 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The text describes a saying in the capital that Malsufrido keeps more secrets than an archbishop. It also says that when he takes off his hat, "the family secrets do not fly out… but remain nicely bottled up," suggesting that he will not betray his confidences.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn't reflect the text. While his hat is large and appears to have been brushed in the wrong direction, Dr. Malsufrido does not seem to be regarded as ill-dresed or disheveled. Choice C is incorrect. This choice is the opposite of what the text says. The secrets of families (his and others') remain "bottled up" in his head. Choice D is incorrect. This choice isn't supported by the text. His professional expertise is not discussed in the passage.

The following text is adapted from Countee Cullen's 1926 poem "Thoughts in a Zoo."

They in their cruel traps, and we in ours, Survey each other's rage, and pass the hours Commiserating each the other's woe, To mitigate his own pain's fiery glow. Man could but little proffer in exchange Save that his cages have a larger range. That lion with his lordly, untamed heart Has in some man his human counterpart, Some lofty soul in dreams and visions wrapped, But in the stifling flesh securely trapped.

Based on the text, what challenge do humans sometimes experience?

A. They cannot effectively tame certain wild animals because of a lack of compassion.

- B. They cannot focus on setting attainable goals because of a lack of motivation.
- C. They quickly become frustrated when faced with difficult tasks because of a lack of self-control.
- D. They have aspirations that cannot be fulfilled because of certain limitations.

#### ID: 2fdfe002 Answer

Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The text metaphorically likens humans to animals in a zoo, suggesting that humans have dreams that they cannot fulfill because they are trapped.

Choice A is incorrect. The speaker says that the lion has an "untamed heart," but the speaker doesn't actually mention anything about humans taming wild animals or a lack of compassion. Choice B is incorrect. The speaker doesn't suggest that humans lack motivation. Rather, the speaker thinks that humans are "trapped" and prevented from achieving their dreams. Choice C is incorrect. The speaker doesn't mention anything about humans becoming frustrated or lacking self-control. Rather, the speaker thinks that humans are "trapped" and prevented from achieving their dreams.

For centuries, the widespread acknowledgment of the cerebellum-a dense brain structure in vertebrates—in coordinating motor control in humans has hindered recognition of other possible functions of the structure. Neuroscience research from the last two decades now suggests that the cerebellum regulates emotion and social behavior, and recent research by Ilaria Carta and colleagues has identified a pathway connecting the cerebellum to a center for motivation and reward processing known as the ventral area (VTA).

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

- A. The recent verification of a pathway between the VTA and the cerebellum confirms the cerebellum's longsuspected role in motor coordination.
- B. Recent advances in the field of neuroscience have challenged widely accepted claims about the function of a pathway connecting the VTA and the cerebellum.
- C. The cerebellum has primarily been thought to requlate motor functioning, but in recent years neuroscience researchers have been uncovering additional functions.
- D. Technological limitations have historically hindered the study of the recent development of new technologies has led to greater insights into its functions.

#### ID: 96802cc0 Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The text says that the cerebellum has long been thought to regulate motor functioning, but new research shows that it may also have other functions—including requlating emotion and social behavior and some connection to motivation and rewards processing.

Choice A is incorrect. The VTA is described as "a center for motivation and reward processing," and the discovery of the pathway between the VTA and the cerebellum supports the theory that the cerebellum is involved in functions other than motor coordination. Choice B is incorrect. The text says that recent research has identified this pathway, but it doesn't discuss any previous "widely accepted claims" about the pathway's function. The "widespread acknowledgement" mentioned early in the passage is about the cerebellum alone, not its connection to the VTA. Choice D is incorrect. The text never discusses any technological limitations or any new technologies.

Algae living within the tissues of corals play a critical role in keeping corals, and the marine ecosystems they are part of, thriving. Some coral species appear brown in color when healthy due to the algae colonies living in their tissues. In the event of an environmental stressor, the algae can die or be expelled, causing the corals to appear white. To recover the algae, the bleached corals then begin to produce bright colors, which block intense sunlight, encouraging the light-sensitive algae to recolonize the corals.

What does the text most strongly suggest about corals that produce bright colors?

A. These corals have likely been subjected to stressful environmental conditions.

B. These corals are likely more vulnerable to exposure from intense sunlight than white corals are.

C. These corals have likely recovered from an environmental event without the assistance of algae colonies.

- D. These corals are more likely to survive without algae colonies than brown corals are.
# ID: d0fbf1ae Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The text says that corals produce bright colors to block sunlight and encourage algae to recolonize after "an environmental stressor." From this, we can infer that corals that produce bright colors have probably been subjected to an environmental stressor.

Choice B is incorrect. The text says that corals produce bright colors to block intense sunlight, which protects the light-sensitive algae that keep the coral healthy. In other words, bright colors make the coral's health less vulnerable to intense sunlight. Choice C is incorrect. The text says that corals produce bright colors to encourage algae to recolonize, not that they have recovered without the assistance of algae colonies. Choice D is incorrect. The text never compares the likelihood of differently colored corals surviving without algae colonies.

Having written the impassioned call to arms "Letter to the Spanish Americans" in 1791, Peruvian intellectual Juan Pablo Viscardo y Guzmán is often considered a forerunner for the independence movements in Latin America. But Viscardo's role in history would have remained insignificant were it not for Venezuelan revolutionary Francisco de Miranda, who was handed the unpublished letter after Viscardo's death. Miranda not only helped circulate the letter, but his edits and footnotes to the text position Miranda as a central figure in the text's creation.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

- A. The original authorship of "Letter to the Spanish Americans" is disputed by contemporary historians.
- B. The majority of the most eloquently stated arguments in "Letter to the Spanish Americans" were written by Miranda.
- C. Miranda played a crucial role in influencing the content and distribution of "Letter to the Spanish Americans."
- D. "Letter to the Spanish Americans" persuaded many people in Latin America to pursue national independence.

#### ID: 14189fbb Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The text describes how Miranda circulated, edited, and added footnotes to "Letter to the Spanish Americans," and it claims that the letter and its author would have "remained insignificant" if it weren't for Miranda's efforts.

Choice A is incorrect. The text only says that Viscardo wrote the letter and that Miranda edited it: it never suggests that the original authorship of the letter is up for debate. Choice B is incorrect. This contradicts the text. The text says that Miranda edited and footnoted the letter, but it identifies Viscardo as the letter's author. It also never identifies certain arguments as more eloquent than others. Choice D is incorrect. This is outside the scope of the text. The paragraph describes Miranda's role in the creation and distribution of the letter, but it doesn't get into the effects of the letter on other people.

In a paper about p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells (one of several perovskite cell architectures designed to collect and store solar power), Lyndsey McMillon-Brown et al. describe a method for fabricating the cell's electronic transport layer (ETL) using a spray coating. Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale-an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as "highly reproducible, concise, and practical."

What does the text most strongly suggest about conventional ETL fabrication?

- A. It is less suitable for manufacturing large volumes of planar p-i-n perovskite solar cells than an alternative fabrication method may be.
- B. It is more expensive when manufacturing at scale than are processes for fabricating ETLs used in other perovskite solar cell architectures.
- C. It typically entails a greater loss of nanoparticle solution than do other established approaches for ETL fabrication.
- D. It is somewhat imprecise and therefore limits the potential effectiveness of p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells at capturing and storing solar power.

### ID: 4d3e3c52 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. Conventional solar cell fabrication increases "the cost of manufacturing at scale", but spray coating might get rid of that problem.

Choice B is incorrect. This is not completely supported by the text. While it's true that conventional ETL fabrication is expensive at scale, there's nothing in the text that mentions other perovskite solar cell architectures. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not match the text. Only one conventional method of ETL fabrication is described, so we can't compare the solution loss in this method to that of other conventional methods. Choice D is incorrect. This choice isn't supported by the text. The text never suggests that the effectiveness of solar cells changes based on their method of fabrication.

Disco remains one of the most ridiculed popular music genres of the late twentieth century. But as scholars have argued, the genre is far less superficial than many people believe. Take the case of disco icon Donna Summer: she may have been associated with popular songs about love and heartbreak (subjects hardly unique to disco, by the way), but like many Black women singers before her, music also reflects concerns about community and identity. These concerns are present in many of the genre's greatest songs, and they generally don't require much digging to reveal.

What does the text most strongly suggest about the disco genre?

- A. It has been unjustly ignored by most scholars despite the importance of the themes addressed by many of the genre's songs.
- B. It evolved over time from a superficial genre focused on romance to a genre focused on more serious concerns.
- C. It has been unfairly dismissed for the inclusion of subject matter that is also found in other musical genres.
- D. It gave rise to a Black women's musical tradition that has endured even though the genre itself faded in the late twentieth century.

### ID: d1b8a9ad Answer

Correct Answer: C

### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The text argues that disco is "far less superficial" than its popular perception might indicate, and that love and heartbreak are "subjects hardly unique to disco."

Choice A is incorrect. This choice conflicts with the text, which says that scholars arque that disco "is far less superficial than many people believe." Choice B is incorrect. This choice says the opposite of what the text suggests. The writer argues that the genre is not as superficial as commonly believed, but that it always reflected "concerns about community and identity." Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn't support this choice. There's nothing in the text about disco giving rise to an enduring Black women's musical tradition.

ln a study of new technology adoption, Davit Marikyan et al. examined negative disconfirmation (which occurs when experiences fall short of one's expectations) to determine whether it could lead to positive outcomes for users. The team focused on established users of "smart home" technology, which presents inherent utilization challenges but tends to attract users with high expectations, often leading to feelings of dissonance. The researchers found that many users employed cognitive mechanisms to mitigate those feelings, ultimately reversing their initial sense of disappointment.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

- A. Research suggests that most users of smart home technology will not achieve a feeling of satisfaction given the utilization challenges of such technology.
- B. Although most smart home technology is aimed at meeting users' high expectations, those expectations in general remain poorly understood.
- C. Research suggests that users with high expectations for a new technology can feel content with that technology even after experiencing negative disconfirmation.
- D. Although neqative disconfirmation has often been studied, little is known about the cognitive mechanisms shaping users' reactions to it in the context of new technology adoption.

### ID: d2e0cba5 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The passage begins by describing the study, and concludes with its results: "many users employed cognitive mechanisms to mitigate those feelings [of neqative disconfirmation]."

Choice A is incorrect. This is the opposite of what the text claims. Rather, the researchers found that "many users" reversed "their initial sense of disappointment." Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn't reflect the text. What the expectations of smart home tech users are is not discussed. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn't reflect the text.

Optical tweezers are specialized scientific tools-particularly useful in biology and medicine-that use highpowered beams of light to trap and manipulate minuscule particles for study. Use of the tool has led to several scientific and medical breakthroughs over the last few decades, but the particles are often under prolonged exposure to the intense heat of the light beams. To overcome the risk of overheating, and thereby damage, researchers sometimes attach nano-sized glass beads to particles, allowing the light to focus on the beads instead of the particles.

Based on the text, what is one advantage of attaching glass beads to particles when using optical tweezers?

A. It decreases the time it takes for the optical tweezers to locate and capture the particles.

B. It facilitates the maneuvering of particles without directly heating the particles themselves.

- C. It allows researchers to use weaker light beams to manipulate particles.
D. It adds a material to which particles can transfer any heat absorbed from the optical tweezers' light beam.

ID: 7c9a65bb Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The text says that the glass beads get the "focus" of the light beams so that the particles don't overheat. From this, we can infer that the beads allow the particles to be manipulated without being directly heated by the light beams.

Choice A is incorrect. The text never says that attaching the glass beads saves time in any way. Choice C is incorrect. The text never says that attaching the glass beads allows researchers to use weaker light beams. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn't say that the particles can transfer heat to the glass beads-rather, it says the heat from the light focuses on the glass beads instead of the particles.

3.11

Some animal-behavior studies involve observing wild animals in their natural habitat, and some involve capturing wild animals and observing them in a laboratory. Each approach has advantages over the other. In wild studies, researchers can more easily presume that the animals are behaving normally, and in lab studies, researchers can more easily control factors that might affect the results. But if, for example, the results from a wild study and a lab study of Western scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica) contradict each other, one or both of the studies must have failed to account for some factor that was relevant to the birds' behavior.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

- A. When the results of a natural-habitat study and those from a lab study of a wild animal such as the Western scrub-jay conflict, the study in the natural habitat is more likely than the lab study to have accurate results.
- B. Studying wild animals such as the Western scrub-jay in both their natural habitat and lab settings is likely to yield conflicting results that researchers cannot fully resolve.
- C. Wild animals such as the Western scrub-jay can be effectively studied in their natural habitat and in the lab, but each approach has drawbacks that could affect the accuracy of the findings.
- D. Differing results between natural-habitat and lab studies of wild animals such as the Western scrub-jay are a strong indication that both of the studies had design flaws that affected the accuracy of their results.

## ID: a3fb5e77 Answer

#### Correct Answer: C

### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text begins by explaining that wild animals can be studied in their natural habitat or in a laboratory setting, with each setting offering unique advantages to researchers. The text then highlights an instance in which Western scrub-jays were studied in both settings but with conflicting results, indicating that one or both studies may have failed to account for the disadvantages of its research setting. Thus, the main idea of the text is that while wild animals can be effectively studied in natural or lab settings, there are drawbacks to each that need to be considered to ensure accurate results.

Choice A is incorrect because the text does not position one study setting (natural or lab) as superior to the other, rather, the text states that each one has advantages over the other. Choice B is incorrect. The text provides a hypothetical example of two studies in different environments with conflicting results, but this single example cannot be extrapolated to a general claim about the likelihood that results of studies in different environments will conflict. Additionally, the text does not assert anything about how researchers can or cannot resolve conflicting study results. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not state that discrepancies between natural-habitat and lab-based animal behavior studies are due to both of the designs

{11}------------------------------------------------

being flawed. Rather, the text states that the conflict in results can be the consequence of one or both of the studies having failed to account for some factor.

Artificial leaves are a developing renewable energy technology that mimics the process of photosynthesis in plants. These devices are silicon-based solar cells coated in chemical catalysts that activate reactions that split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen gas. The technology, while generating lots of interest, is not yet commercially viable as a large-scale energy source. To meet this challenge, scientists from many fields are researching ways to store, transport, and distribute the energy the devices produce while other scientists are working to improve the cost and efficiency of the devices.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

Continued research and development in artificial-leaf technology is needed before the devices can be widely used as an A. energy source.

The recent increase in the commercial use of artificial leaves as an energy source has encouraged many scientists to B. research ways to improve the technology.

Artificial leaves split water molecules into oxygen qas using catalysts more efficiently than plants do using C. the process of photosynthesis.

Artificial leaves were developed to mimic the natural process of photosynthesis in plants in order to store energy for long-D. term commercial use.

## ID: 6762772f Answer

### Correct Answer: A

### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text, artificial leaves are a renewable energy technology that's in development and generating interest. The text goes on to state that artificial-leaf technology "is not yet commercially viable as a larqe-scale energy source" and that scientists from several fields are doing additional research to refine the technology. Thus, the main idea is that continued research and development in artificial-leaf technology is needed before the devices can be widely used as an energy source.

Choice B is incorrect. While the text does state that scientists from many fields are researching artificial leaves, they're doing so to address the fact that the leaves are not yet commercially viable, rather than in response to an increase in commercial use. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does explain that artificial leaves help split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen gas using catalysts, it doesn't argue that this process is more efficient than photosynthesis. This is merely a detail of the text and not the main idea, which is about the additional research needed to improve the cost and efficiency of these artificial leaves. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that artificial leaves mimic photosynthesis in plants, this is an incidental detail in support of the main idea that additional research is needed to make artificial leaves commercially viable.

Electronic music pioneer Wendy Carlos is credited with the music for three feature films: A Clockwork Orange (1971), The Shining (1980), and Tron (1982). However, her musical score for A Clockwork Orange is mostly made up of her arrangements of Ludwig van Beethoven's work. Also, almost all the music that she and Rachel Elkind composed for The Shining was unused by director Stanley Kubrick. It did not appear in the films, Tron is the one in which audiences can hear the most of Carlos's original compositions.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

- A. Of the three films for which Carlos is credited, Tron features the most original music from her.
- B. The director of The Shining used most of the music that Carlos composed for it.
- C. Beethoven is widely considered to be a more important composer than Carlos.
- D. Carlos is a notable innovator among film composers in the 1970s and 1980s.

## ID: 2df56712 Answer

### Correct Answer: A

### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer because it best states the main idea of the text indicates that Wendy Carlos scored three feature films: A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, and Tron. It also indicates that Carlos's work on A Clockwork Orange consisted primarily of electronic arrangements of Beethoven compositions and that very little of what she and Rachel Elkind composed for The Shining was used in the soundtrack for Tron consists largely of music composed by Carlos, so it contains more of her original music than do the soundtracks for the main idea of the text is that of the three films for which Carlos is credited, Tron features the most original music from her.

Choice B is incorrect because it directly contradicts the text's claim that "very little of what she and Rachel Elkind composed for The Shining was used in the film." Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't address the perceived quality of different composers, instead, it discusses how much of Carlos's original work was used in each of the three films she scored. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn't relate to any of the text: the work Wendy Carlos did for three feature films, how much of that work was composed by Carlos, and how much of her original work was ultimately used in the film.
