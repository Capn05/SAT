2.1

A common assumption among art historians is that the invention of photography in the mid-nineteenth century displaced the painted portrait in the public consciousness. The diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature, which coincided with the rise of photography, seems to support this claim. However, photography's impact on the portrait miniature may be overstated. Although records from art exhibitions in the Netherlands from 1820 to 1892 show a decrease in the number of both full-sized and miniature portraits submitted, this trend was established before the invention of photography.

Based on the text, what can be concluded about the diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature in the nineteenth century?

- A. Factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature's decline.
- B. Although portrait miniatures became less common than photographs, they were widely regarded as having more artistic merit.
- C. The popularity of the portrait miniature likely persisted for longer than art historians have assumed.
- D. As demand for portrait miniatures decreased, portrait artists likely shifted their creative focus to photography.

#### ID: 87aa7bab Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The text says that the impact of photography on the portrait miniature might be "overstated," as some records show a decrease in the number of portrait miniatures before the invention of photography. From this, we can conclude that factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature's decline.

Choice B is incorrect. The text never discusses the "artistic merit" of either art form. Choice C is incorrect. The text never suggests that the portrait miniature was popular for longer than historians thought—if anything, it suggests that the portrait miniature started losing its popularity earlier than historians thought. Choice D is incorrect. The text never suggests that portrait painters shifted to become photographers.

2.2

Biologists have predicted that birds' feather structures vary with habitat temperature, but this hadn't been tested in mountain environments. Ornithologist Sahas Barve studied feathers from 249 songbird species inhabiting different elevations-and thus experiencing different temperatures-in the Himalaya Mountains. He found that feathers of high-elevation species not only have a greater proportion of warming downy sections to flat and smooth sections than do feathers of low-elevation species, but high-elevation species' feathers also tend to be longer, providing a thicker layer of insulation.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

- A. Barve's investigation shows that some species of Himalayan songbirds have evolved feathers that better regulate body temperature than do the feathers of other species, contradicting previous predictions.
- B. Barve found an association between habitat temperature and feather structure among Himalayan songbirds, lending new support to a general prediction.
- C. Barve discovered that songbirds have adapted to their environment by growing feathers without flat and smooth sections, complicating an earlier hypothesis.
- D. The results of Barve's study suggest that the ability of birds to withstand cold temperatures is determined more strongly by feather length than feather structure, challenging an established belief.

## ID: 602b47c7 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The text describes how Barve found an association between habitat temperature and feather structure among Himalayan songbirds, which supports the general prediction that birds' feather structures vary with habitat temperature.

Choice A is incorrect. Barve's study isn't said to contradict previous predictions. In fact, the study supports the prediction described in the first sentence, which is that birds' feather structures vary with habitat temperature. Choice C is incorrect. Barve's study isn't said to "complicate an earlier hypothesis." In fact, the study supports the earlier prediction described in the first sentence, which is that birds' feather structures vary with habitat temperature. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn't compare the importance of feather length and feather structure, and it doesn't say that Barve's study challenges any established beliefs. In fact, the study supports the prediction described in the first sentence, which is that birds' feather structures vary with habitat temperature.

2.3

Paleontologists searching for signs of ancient life have found many fossilized specimens of prehistoric human ancestors, including several from the Pleistocene era discovered in a geological formation in the Minatogawa quarry in Japan. However, to study the emergence of the earliest multicellular organisms to appear on Earth, researchers must turn elsewhere, such as to the Ediacaran geological formation at Mistaken Point in Canada. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the 146-hectare reserve contains more than 10,000 fossils that together document a critical moment in evolutionary history.

What does the text indicate about the geological formation at Mistaken Point?

- A. It holds a greater number of fossils but from a smaller variety of species than the Minatogawa quarry does.
- B. It has provided evidence that the earliest human species may have emerged before the Pleistocene era.
- C. It is widely considered by paleontologists to be the most valuable source of information about prehistoric life forms.
- D. It contains specimens from an older time period than those found in the Minatogawa quarry.

## ID: 11a9f635 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The text says that the formation at Mistaken Point contains fossils of "the earliest multicellular organisms," which implies that these fossils are from an older time period than the fossils of "prehistoric human ancestors" found in the Minatogawa quarry.

Choice A is incorrect. The text says that the formation at Mistake Point contains "more than 10,000 fossils"," but it doesn't compare this number of fossils in the Minatogawa quarry. It also doesn't say anything about the variety of species in either formation. Choice B is incorrect. The text says that the formation at Mistaken Point contains fossils of "the earliest multicellular organisms," but it never says that the site contains early human fossils too. Rather, the early human fossils mentioned in the text were found in the formation at Minatogawa quarry. Choice C is incorrect. The text says that the fossils at Mistaken Point "document a critical moment in evolutionary history" but it never says that Mistaken Point is the most valuable source of information about prehistoric life forms.

The following text is adapted from Edgar Allan Poe's 1849 story "Landor's Cottage."

During a pedestrian trip last summer, through one or two of the river counties of New York, I found myself, as the day declined, somewhat embarrassed about the road I was pursuing. The land undulated very remarkably; and my path, for the last hour, had wound about so confusedly, in its effort to keep in the valleys, that I no longer knew in what direction lay the sweet village of B——, where I had determined to stop for the night.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

- A. The narrator remembers a trip he took and admits to getting lost.
- B. The narrator recalls fond memories of a journey that he took through some beautiful river counties.
- C. The narrator describes what he saw during a long trip through a frequently visited location.
- D. The narrator explains the difficulties he encountered on a trip and how he overcame them.

## ID: e677fa6c Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The narrator is "embarrassed" about the took, which ends up leaving him lost and confused about how to get to his destination for the evening.

Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn't match the passage. The narrator is embarrassed, rather than fond, and he doesn't describe the beauty of the place. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn't match the passage. We don't know from this excerpt whether or not the narrator has visited this part of New York multiple times. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn't match the passage. The narrator doesn't explain how he overcame being lost in this excerpt.

Philadelphia's Black Pearl Chamber Orchestra, founded by Jeri Lynne Johnson, performs classical music, from well-known compositions by Beethoven to contemporary works by Jessie Montgomery. For the orchestra's iConduct! program, Johnson invites community members to learn some basic elements of conducting and then experience conducting the Black Pearl orchestra themselves.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

- A. The Black Pearl orchestra performs music from all over the world but mostly performs music composed by Philadelphians.
- B. Johnson founded the Black Pearl orchestra to perform classical music by contemporary artist Jessie Montgomery.
- C. The Black Pearl orchestra gives community members the chance to and participate in classical music performance.
- D. Johnson has community members conduct an orchestrate how difficult the task is.

#### ID: 5325b3cc Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text begins by stating that the Black Pearl orchestra performs classical music, and then goes on to explain that the orchestra offers an iConduct! program. According to the text, this program offers community members the opportunity to learn some basics about conducting and then apply what they learn by conducting the orchestra themselves. Thus, the main idea of the text is that community members can both listen to and participate in a classical music performance.

Choice A is incorrect. Although the text states that the Black Pearl orchestra is based in Philadelphia, it doesn't indicate that most of the music it plays was composed by Philadelphians. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does state that Johnson founded the Black Pearl orchestra, this is just a detail and not the main focus of the text. Moreover, while the text does say that the orchestra sometimes plays music by Montgomery, it doesn't assert that the orchestra was founded solely for the purpose of performing Montgomery's work. Choice D is incorrect. Although that community members are invited to conduct the Black Pearl orchestra after participating in the iConduct! program, the text doesn't indicate that Johnson allows community members to do this for the specific purpose of showing how difficult the task is.

To dye wool, Navajo (Diné) weaver Lillie Taylor uses plants and vegetables from Arizona, where she lives. For example, she achieved the deep reds and browns featured in her 2003 rug In the Path of the Four Seasons by using Arizona dock roots, drying and grinding them before mixing the powder with water to create a dye bath. To intensify the appearance of certain colors, Taylor also sometimes mixes in clay obtained from nearby soil.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

- A. Reds and browns are not commonly featured in most of Taylor's rugs.
- B. Taylor draws on local resources in the approach she uses to dye wool.
- C. Taylor finds it difficult to locate Arizona dock root in the desert.
- D. In the Path of the Four Seasons is widely acclaimed for its many colors and innovative weaving techniques.

#### ID: dc3ea63e Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. It best states the main idea of the text opens with the statement that Taylor uses local plants and vegetables to dye wool. The rest describes how she does this.

Choice A is incorrect. This doesn't state the main idea of the text only mentions one rug: In the Path of the Four Seasons, in which reds and browns are featured. It never mentions whether or not these colors are featured in her other rugs. Choice C is incorrect. This doesn't state the main idea of the text never says that Taylor finds it difficult to locate Arizona dock roots. Choice D is incorrect. This doesn't state the main idea of the text. The text never says that In the Path of the Four Seasons is widely acclaimed. Rather, it discusses the rug to illustrate the point made earlier in the passage: that Taylor uses local plants and vegetables to dye wool.

2.7

The painter María Izquierdo played an important role in the development of twentieth-century Mexican art, but her work has never been well-known in the United States except among art historians. One reason for Izquierdo's relative obscurity is the enormous popularity of some of her peers. In particular, the painters Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera have so captivated the interest of US audiences that Izquierdo and other Mexican artists from the period often get overlooked, despite the high quality of their work.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

- A. Izquierdo's work is not as well-known in the United States as it should be because Kahlo and Rivera draw so much of the public's attention.
- B. During Izquierdo's lifetime, here displayed in galleries in the United States much more frequently than paintings by Kahlo and Rivera were.
- C. Izquierdo painted some of the same subjects that Kahlo and Rivera painted but used different techniques than they used.
- D. Few of Izquierdo's works are in galleries today because she produced only a small number of paintings.

## ID: a59245a1 Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text begins by stating that María Izquierdo was an important figure in the history of twentieth-century Mexican art, but despite her importance, her work hasn't received widespread recognition in the United States. According to the text, one reason for this is that Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera are so famous in the US that they overshadow other important Mexican artists, including Izquierdo. Thus, the text is that Izquierdo's work is less well known in the US than it should be because Kahlo and Rivera draw most of the public's attention.

Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn't discuss the appearance of Izquierdo's paintings in qalleries in the US during her lifetime, nor does it suggest that her paintings were displayed more frequently than paintings by Kahlo or Rivera were. Instead, the text focuses on the fact that Izquierdo has been overlooked in the US because of Kahlo's and Rivera's greater popularity. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't discuss either the subject matter of Izquierdo's paintings or the techniques she used, nor does it compare these aspects of her paintings with those of Kahlo's and Rivera's paintings. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't mention how many of Izquierdo's paintings appear in galleries today, nor does it state that she produced only a small number of paintings.

Many intellectual histories of the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s rely heavily on essays and other explicitly ideological works as primary sources, a tendency that can overrepresent the perspectives of a small number of thinkers, most of whom were male. Historian Ashley D. Farmer has shown that expanding the array of primary sources to encompass more types of print material—including political cartoons, advertisements, and artwork-leads to a much better understanding of the movement and the crucial and diverse roles that Black women played in shaping it.

Which choice best describes the main idea of the text?

- A. Farmer's methods and research have enriched the historical understanding of the Black Power movement and Black women's contributions to it.
- B. Before Farmer's research, historians had largely ignored the intellectual dimensions of the Black Power movement.
- C. Other historians of the Black Power movement have criticized Farmer's use of unconventional primary sources.
- D. The figures in the Black Power movement whom historians tend to cite would have agreed with Farmer's conclusions about women's roles in the movement.

## ID: f8befe75 Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. It best describes the main idea of the text starts by saying that historians of the Black Power movement are too reliant on openly ideological works, which were written mostly by men, as sources. The text then describes Farmer's research: she has shown that including other kinds of sources leads to a better understanding of the Black Power movement and the role Black women played in it.

Choice B is incorrect. This doesn't describe the main idea of the text. In fact, it conflicts with the text. The text says that historians have relied on "essays and other explicitly ideological works," which suggests that they have studied at least some of the intellectual dimensions of the Black Power movement. Choice C is incorrect. This doesn't describe the main idea of the text. The text never mentions how other historians of the Black Power movement view Farmer's use of unconventional sources. In fact, the text itself argues in favor of Farmer's research, claiming that it has led to a "much better understanding of the movement." Choice D is incorrect. This doesn't describe the main idea of the text. The text never mentions what any figures in the Black Power movement thought about women's roles in the movement.

2.9

In many of his sculptures, artist Richard Hunt uses broad forms rather than extreme accuracy to hint at specific people or ideas. In his first major work, Arachne (1956), Hunt constructed the mythical character Arachne, a weaver who was changed into a spider, by welding bits of steel together into something that, although vaguely human, is strange and machine-like. And his large bronze sculpture The Light of Truth (2021) commemorates activist and journalist Ida B. Wells using mainly flowing, curved pieces of metal that create stylized flame.

Which choice best states the text's main idea about Hunt?

A. He often depicts the subjects of his sculptures using an unrealistic style.

B. He uses different kinds of materials depending on what kind of sculpture he plans to create.

C. He tends to base his art on important historical figures rather than on fictional characters.

D. He has altered his approach to sculpture over time, and his works have become increasingly abstract.

## ID: 3f05e40f Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text, many of Richard Hunt's sculptures "use broad forms rather than extreme accuracy" – in other words, they are more abstract than realistic. To illustrate Hunt's abstract approach, the text characterizes his sculpture of Arachne as "vaguely human" and his work in honor of Ida B. Wells as "using mainly flowing, curved pieces of metal that create stylized flame." Thus, the main idea is that Hunt often depicts of his sculptures using an unrealistic style.

Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that one of Hunt's sculptures is made of steel and another of bronze, there is no mention of why he chose these materials. Choice C is incorrect because the text says nothing about how Hunt chose the subjects for his sculptures. Furthermore, of the two examples provided in the text, only Ida B. Wells is an important historical figure; Arachne is a "mythical character." Choice D is incorrect because the text says nothing about how Hunt's style changed over time. In fact, although the two examples of Hunt's work discussed in the text were created 65 years apart, they are both described as heavily stylized rather than realistic, which may suggest that some aspects of Hunt's style haven't changed over that time.

The following text is adapted from Robert Louis Stevenson's 1883 novel Treasure Island. Bill is a sailor staying at the Admiral Benbow, an inn run by the narrator's parents.

Every day when [Bill] came back from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the road. At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid them. When a seaman did [stay] at the Admiral Benbow (as now and then some did) he would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the parlour; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such was present.

According to the text, why does Bill regularly ask about "seafaring men"?

- A. He's hoping to find an old friend and fellow sailor.
- B. He's trying to secure a job as part of the crew on a new ship.
- C. He isn't sure that other quests at the inn will be welcoming of sailors.

The following text is adapted from Guy de Maupassant's nineteenth-century short story "The Trip of Le Horla" (translated by Albert M. C. McMaster, A. E. Henderson, Mme. Quesada, et al.). The narrator is part of a group traveling in a hot-air balloon at night.

The earth no longer seems to exist, it is buried in milky vapors that resemble a sea. We are now alone in space with the moon, which looks like another balloon travelling opposite us; and our balloon, which shines in the air, appears like another, larger moon, a world wandering in the stars, through infinity. We no longer speak, think nor live; we float along through space in delicious inertia. The air which is bearing us up has made of us all beings which resemble itself, silent, joyous, irresponsible beings, peculiarly alert, although motionless.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

- A. The narrator feels a growing sense of isolation even though his companions are nearby during the balloon ride.
- B. The narrator and his companions are completely absorbed in the change in perspective they gain while riding in the balloon.
- C. The narrator and his companions are troubled by the disorienting effects of the altitude while riding in the balloon.
- D. The narrator is pleasantly surprised by his companions' unrestrained enthusiasm about the sensation of riding in the balloon.

## ID: d5c2a4d4 Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The narrator describes the view he and his companions have from the balloon: the earth "milky vapors" and the balloon itself looks like another moon. The narrator goes on to explain how the people riding in the balloon are affected by the ride, explaining that they are immersed in the experience: floating along in "delicious inertia," or inactivity, like "silent, joyous, irresponsible beings." Thus, the main idea is that the narrator and his companions are completely absorbed in the change in perspective they gain while riding in the balloon.

Choice A is incorrect because the narrator never describes himself as feeling isolated from his companions; instead, he characterizes riding in the balloon as an experience he is sharing with them. And although he does imply a sense of isolation, it is isolation from those on the ground, as when he says of himself and his companions, "We are now alone" Choice C is incorrect because the narrator doesn't suggest that he or his companions are troubled by the effects of the balloon ride. Instead, he describes himself and his companions as "joyous" and the experience of floating in the balloon as "delicious." Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the narrator is surprised by his companions' response to the balloon ride. In fact, the

The recovery of a 1,000-year-old Chinese shipwreck in the Java Sea near present-day Indonesia has yielded a treasure trove of artifacts, including thousands of small ceramic bowls. Using a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer tool, Lisa Niziolek and her team were able to detect the chemical composition of these bowls without damaging them. By comparing the chemical signatures of the materials still at old Chinese kiln sites, Niziolek and her team can pinpoint which Chinese kilns likely produced the ceramic bowls.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

- A. Because of a new technology, researchers can locate and recover more shipwrecks than they could in the past.
- B. Researchers have been able to identify the location of a number of Chinese kilns in operation 1,000 years ago.
- C. With the help of a special tool, researchers have determined the likely origin of bowls recovered from a shipwreck.
- D. Before the invention of portable X-ray fluorescence, researchers needed to take a small piece out of an artifact to analyze its components.

### ID: ad680167 Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text, thousands of ceramic bowls were found in a recovered Chinese shipwreck. The text goes on to say that Niziolek and her team used a special tool, a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer, to determine the bowls' chemical signatures. Comparing these chemical signatures with the chemical signatures of materials they had collected from old Chinese kiln sites, the text says, allowed the researchers to identify which killns had produced the bowls. In other words, the researchers determined the bowls' origin.

Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the researchers used technology in the form of a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer, it doesn't specifically state that this technology is new. In addition, the text says that Niziolek and her team used the tool to determine the chemical composition of bowls that were found in a Chinese shipwreck, not to locate and recover the shipwreck itself. There's no indication in the text that a new technology can help researchers locate and recover shipwrecks. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the researchers collected materials from old kiln sites for chemical comparison with the ceramic bowls, which means that the researchers must have already known the location of those killn sites. Rather than identifying the location of the researchers determined which kilns in operation 1,000 years ago had likely produced the bowls that were found in the shipwreck. Choice D is incorrect.

The following text is adapted from Christina Rossetti's 1881 poem "Monna Innominata 2."

I wish I could remember that first day,

First hour, first moment of your meeting me,

If bright or dim the season, it might be

Summer or Winter for [all] I can say;

So unrecorded did it slip away,

So blind was I to see and to foresee,

So dull to mark the budding of my tree

That would not blossom yet for many a May.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

- A. The speaker celebrates how the passage of time has strengthened a relationship that once seemed unimportant.
- B. Because the speaker did not anticipate how important a relationship would become, she cannot recall how the relationship began, which she regrets.
- C. As the anniversary of the beginning of an important relationship approaches, the speaker feels conflicted about how best to commemorate it.
- D. After years of neglecting a once valuable relationship, the speaker worries it may be too late for her to salvage the relationship.

#### ID: adbcbce0 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The speaker says that they could remember when they first met someone, but they can't remember the meeting at all, because they didn't know at the that the relationship would "blossom" later on.

Choice A is incorrect. The speaker does say that the relationship has "blossomed" over time, but only briefly at the end-and they don't really "celebrate" that fact. Rather, the text has a more regretful tone: it's about how the speaker can't remember first meeting this person, and they wish they could. Choice C is incorrect. The speaker doesn't mention an anniversary—in fact, the speaker can't remember when they met the person they're talking about. Choice D is incorrect. The speaker doesn't say that they neglected the relationship. In fact, the speaker suggests that the relationship has become very important to them-that's why the speaker wishes that they could remember their first meeting.

The ice melted on a Norwegian mountain during a particularly warm summer in 2019, revealing a 1,700-year-old sandal to a mountaineer looking for artifacts. The sandal would normally have degraded quickly, but it was instead well preserved for centuries by the surrounding ice. According to archaeologist Espen Finstad and his team, the sandal, like those worn by imperial Romans, wouldn't have offered any protection from the cold in the mountains, so some kind of insulation, like fabric or animal skin, would have needed to be worn on the feet with the sandal.

What does the text indicate about the discovery of the sandal?

- A. Temperatures contributed to both protecting and revealing the sandal.
- B. The discovery revealed that the Roman Empire had more influence on Norway than archaeologists previously assumed.
- C. Archaeologists would have found the sandal eventually without help from the general public.
- D. The sandal would have degraded if it hadn't been removed from the ice.

#### ID: 95146ebb Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. A "particularly warm summer" revealed the sandal, and centuries of ice kept it "well preserved."

Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn't reflect the information in the text. The sandal is similar to Roman sandals, but there is no indication that it was a result of Roman influence. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn't support this choice. We don't have enough information to know whether or not archaeologists would have found the sandal without people like the treasure-hunting mountaineer. Choice D is incorrect. The text says the opposite of this choice. The sandal was preserved by the ice for centuries.

To protect themselves when being attacked, hagfish—jawless marine animals that resemble eels—will release large quantities of slimy, mucus-like threads. Because these threads are unusually strong and elastic, scientist Atsuko Negishi and her colleagues have been trying to recreate them in a lab as an eco-friendly alternative to petroleum-based fibers that are often used in fabrics. The researchers want to reproduce the threads in the lab because farming hagfish for their slime would be expensive and potentially harmful to the hagfish.

Which choice best states the text's main idea?

- A. The slimy threads that hagfish release might help researchers create a new kind of fabric.
- B. Hagfish have inspired researchers to develop a new petroleum-based fabric.
- C. Hagfish are not well suited to being raised in captivity.
- D. The ability of hagfish to slime their attackers compensates for their being jawless.

## ID: 409058ee Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The text first describes hagfish slime and its properties, then it transitions to talking about the possibilities of using lab-made equivalents to use in eco-friendly fabrics.

Choice B is incorrect. The text says the opposite of this choice. The researchers are developing an alternative to petroleum-based fabric. Choice C is incorrect. This choice is too narrow to be the main point of the text. Only one line describes how farming would be "potentially harmful" to the hagfish. Choice D is incorrect. This choice isn't supported by the text. We don't know from the text whether being jawless makes the hagfish more vulnerable.

Using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), a team of astronomers mapped out the magnetic field of G47, one of the Milky Way's galactic bones (dense clouds of gas and dust that run through the middle of the arm of a spiral galaxy). Surprisingly, the map revealed a magnetic field with no clear pattern or direction. The researchers had expected the magnetic field to be similar to the more uniform fields seen in galactic bones in other arms of the Milky Way.

According to the text, what was surprising about the researchers' mapping of the magnetic field of galactic bone G47?

- A. It showed a weaker magnetic field than expected.
- B. It implied that previous mappings of the magnetic field were inaccurate.
- C. It produced magnetic field measurements similar to those for other galactic bones.
- D. It revealed a magnetic field that wasn't uniform.

## ID: 3cc7d73b Answer

### Correct Answer: D

## Rationale

Choice D is the best answer because it presents the point about the magnetic field mapping that the text describes as surprising. The text indicates that a team of astronomers mapped the magnetic field of G47, a galactic bone in the Milky Way, and that the mapping "surprisingly" revealed "no clear pattern or direction" in the magnetic field. The text then adds that the researchers had thought the magnetic field would be as uniform as the magnetic fields of other galactic bones in the Milky Way are. In other words, the researchers were surprised that the mapping revealed a magnetic field that wasn't uniform.

Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't indicate that the mapping surprisingly showed a weaker magnetic field than the researchers had expected. The text makes no mention of the magnetic field's strength, only its lack of a clear pattern or direction. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn't indicate that the mapping suggested to researchers that previous mappings were inaccurate. Although the text states that the mapping didn't show what researchers had expected based on their knowledge of other magnetic fields, there's no indication that G47's magnetic field had ever been mapped before. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that the researchers were surprised that the magnetic feld was different from, not similar to, the magnetic fields of other galactic bones; the text states that because other galactic bones in the Milky Way are more uniform, the researchers had expected the magnetic field of G47 to be more uniform than it turned out to be.

The following text is from Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar's 1961 novel The Regulation Institute (translated from the Turkish in 2014 by Maureen Freely and Alexander Dawe). The narrator was once involved with the Time Regulation Institute, a fictional bureaucracy that regulates the time of Turkey's clocks.

l may be the most humble and absurd man in the world and, as my wife says, the most slovenly creature you may ever meet—that is, before the founding of our institute—but I did come to know a truly great man who possessed a natural genius for invention. I spent years at his side. I watched the way he worked. I witnessed how an idea would suddenly catch fire in his mind and take shape, like a tree sprouting shoots and branches, before coming into being.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

- A. A person was fortunate enough to have found love despite his obvious shortcomings.
- B. An exceptionally talented person professes humility to avoid intimidating others.
- C. A person appreciates the extensive time he passed in the company of someone he deeply admired.
- D. A truly brilliant person lets ideas mature in his mind before expressing them aloud.

### ID: 668f75cb Answer

#### Correct Answer: C

### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main idea of the text: a person appreciates the extensive time he passed in the company of a man he deeply admired. The spent "years" (a long period of time) in the company of a "truly great man" with "a natural genius for invention." These phrases indicate the speaker's feelings of admiration.

Choice A is incorrect because though the text indicates that the speaker feels professional admiration for the "truly great man," the text does not indicate that the speaker feels love for him; nor does the text indicate that the speaker's humility, absurdity, and slovenly nature proved to be an obstacle to this professional relationship. Choice B is incorrect because though the speaker describes himself as humble, the text does not indicate that he is exceptionally talented; nor does the text indicate that the "truly great man" professes humility or is concerned with whether he intimidates others. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not indicate how either the speaker or the "truly great man" express their ideas.

In present-day Chiapas, Mexico, archaeologist Robert Rosenswig, remote-sensing specialist Ricardo López-Torrijos, and colleagues have located 41 smaller settlements surrounding the ancient Mesoamerican city of Izapa. The researchers have concluded that these settlements were culturally linked to Izapa because each of the same age and configured in the same manner as Izapa, with a pyramid to the north and a plaza to the south. Their shared structural orientation suggests that residents of the settlements likely performed some of the same cultural ceremonies as residents in Izapa did.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

Researchers have determined that the arrangement of Izapa's structures was based on those of other nearby A. settlements.

Cultural ceremonies in Izapa seem to have played a more important role for its residents than those in smaller, B. surrounding settlements did.

Although archaeologists have learned much about Izapa over years of research, they have only recently found the smaller C. settlements that surrounded it.

Researchers have inferred that Izapa was related to the smaller settlements that surrounded it based in part on the D. similarity of their construction.

## ID: 04dff083 Answer

### Correct Answer: D

### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text indicates that Rosenswig, Lopez-Torrijos, and colleagues concluded that there is a cultural link between the city of Izapa and the 41 smaller settlements they located around the city. According to the researchers reached this conclusion because Izapa and the settlements are of the same age and configuration in that all have a pyramid to the north and a plaza to the south. Thus, the main idea of the text is that researchers have inferred that Izapa was related to the surrounded it based in part on the similarity of their construction.

Choice A is incorrect. Although the text discusses a similarity between how structures in Izapa and nearby settlements are arranged, the text doesn't indicate that the arrangement in Izapa is based on those of the nearby settlements. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions that residents of Izapa and its surrounding settlements may have performed the same cultural ceremonies, the text doesn't discuss the ceremonies' importance for the residents. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text describes findings about Izapa, it doesn't specify how much archaeologists have learned about Izapa over the years. Additionally, while the text indicates that the discovery of the 41 smaller settlements surrounding Izapa was made in present-day Chiapas and thus may be of recent date, this is a detail in the text, not its main idea.

Paleontologist Alan Tennyson and colleagues studied fossil bones found in New Zealand that are more than 55 million years old. The researchers determined that the fossil bones belonged to two previously unknown species of prehistoric penguins. Moreover, they estimated that one of the two penguin species was more than three times the size of the emperor penguin, which is the largest penguin species that exists today.

Based on the text, which choice best describes the two previously unknown penguin species?

- A. They are frequently studied by paleontologists.
- B. They are no longer living species.
- C. They were smaller than penguin species that exist today.
- D. They spent little of their lives in water.

## ID: 0d81b7d9 Answer

### Correct Answer: B

### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it presents a statement about the two previously unknown penguin species that is supported by the text. According to the text, Alan Tennyson and colleaques studied fossil bones belonging to two previously unknown penguin species that are described as prehistoric, or ancient. The text goes on to say that one of the two species was considerably larger than the emperor penguin, which is currently the largest penguin in existence. Thus, the text indicates that the other species aren't in existence today, or that the two previously unknown penguin species are no longer living species.

Choice A is incorrect. Although the text states that Alan Tennyson is a paleontologist who studied the fossils of two previously unknown penquin species, it doesn't say whether these penguins are frequently studied by paleontologists. Choice C is incorrect because the text says that one of the two previously unknown penquin species was three times larger than the emperor penguin (a penguin alive today), not that they were both smaller than penguin species that exist today. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't discuss whether the two previously unknown penguin species spent any time in water.

A contraction of "you all," the pronoun "y'all" has long been used as a plural version of "you" in the South and in Black communities around the US. In recent decades, most other English-speaking communities in the US have begun to use "y all." What explains its rise in popularity? Many varieties of English have no pronoun that specifically addresses more than one person and instead must use "you" to address both one person and more than one. But "yall" always refers to two or more people. As a result, it conveys the speaker's meaning more precisely than "you" can.

Which question does the text most directly attempt to answer?

- A. How many other plural versions of the pronoun "you" are there in English, besides "yall"?
- B. Why has the pronoun "y'all" become more widely used in the US?
- C. When was the first recorded use of the pronoun "y'all" in the English language?
- D. Is "y'all" commonly used in English-speaking regions of the world besides the US?

## ID: 11c68ded Answer

### Correct Answer: B

### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it presents a question that the text is attempting to answer: why has the pronoun "y all" become more widely used in the US? The text begins by explaining where and how the plural pronoun "y'all" originated and then goes on to state that its use has been rising in popularity, even in areas outside of its place of origin. The text then attributes this rise in popularity to the fact that many varieties of English do not have a pronoun to address more than one person, and thus "you" must function as both a singular and plural pronoun.

Choice A is incorrect because while the text states that "you" in English, it does not discuss other plural forms of the word. Choice C is incorrect because while the text discusses the general origins of the pronoun "y all," it does not state when the use of the pronoun was first recorded in the English language. Choice D is incorrect because though the text addresses the use of the pronoun "y'all" within English-speaking communities in the US, it does not address its use outside of that geographic area.

During the World War II era, some Mexican women adopted a striking new look called pachuca style. They wore altered mer's jackets or zoot suits (wide-leqged, long-coated suits) and they combed their hair into high, rounded shapes. Some people criticized pachuca style, saying it was dangerous and women should dress traditionally. But historians see things differently. They see pachuca style as a form of rebellion aqainst the era's rigid social expectations for women. They say that it showed a desire for self-expression and freedom on the part of women who adopted the style.

According to the text, how do historians view pachuca style?

They think that pachuca style was such a popular trend that it continues to influence fashion in the United States to the A. present day.

They think that pachuca style was a way for some Mexican women to express themselves and resist strict B. social expectations.

They think that pachuca style was celebrated because it enabled some Mexican women to show their support C. for the United States during World War II.

They think that pachuca style was similar to other fashion trends that different groups of women adopted in the same D. period.

## ID: 8c1be131 Answer

### Correct Answer: B

### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it presents a statement about how historians view pachuca style that is supported by the text. The text first describes the distinctive pachuca style of dress adopted by some Mexican women during World War II, saying that some criticized it and asserted that women should dress traditionally. The text then goes on to contrast this position with that of historians, who "see things differently": according to these historians, the pachuca style showed a wish for freedom and self-expression, and it acted as a kind of rebellion against what society expected of women at the time. Therefore, according to the text, historians think that the pachuca style was a way for Mexican women to express themselves and resist strict social expectations.

Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly describes the pachuca style as a distinctive look adopted during the World War II era. It does not indicate that the pachuca style influences fashion in the United States in the present day. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not indican American women wore the pachuca style to show support for the United States during World War II; rather, the style was a means of self-expression and rebellion aqainst social expectations. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not compare the pachuca style to other fashion trends: the is the only style mentioned.
