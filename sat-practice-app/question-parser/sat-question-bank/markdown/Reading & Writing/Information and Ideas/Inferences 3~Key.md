3.1

Marta Coll and colleagues' 2010 Mediterranean Sea biodiversity census reported approximately 17,000 species, nearly double the number reported in Carlo Bianchi and Carla Morri's 2000 census-a difference only partly attributable to the description of new invertebrate species in the interim. Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers' decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential. Indeed, the two censuses reported similar counts of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, suggesting that __

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. Coll and colleagues reported a much higher number of species than Bianchi and Morri did largely due to the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri's census.
- B. some differences observed in microorganisms may have been treated as variations within species by Bianchi and Morri but treated as indicative of distinct species by Coll and colleagues.
- C. Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to the degree of morphological variation displayed within a typical species of microorganism than Coll and colleagues were.
- D. the absence of clarity regarding how to differentiate among species of microorganisms may have resulted in Coll and colleagues underestimating the number of microorganism species.

### ID: f1bfbed3 Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text's discussion of the different counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues' count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri's count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorqanisms' morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms' structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers' decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences

{1}------------------------------------------------

as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did.

Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate species in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the studies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleaques' count and Bianchi and Morn's count that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri's study. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suqgests that Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Colleagues were. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Colleagues were, Bianchi and Morri would likely have reported more species than Colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation would lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as variations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to withinspecies variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report fewer overall species. Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported many more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorqanism species by Coll and colleagues would not explain that difference—it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should have been even larger.

3.2

Researchers recently found that disruptions to an enjoyable experience, like a short series of advertisements during a television show, often increase viewers' reported enjoyment. Suspecting that disruptions to an unpleasant experience would have the opposite effect, the researchers had participants listen to construction noise for 30 minutes and anticipated that those whose listening experience was frequently interrupted with short breaks of silence would thus ___

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. find the disruptions more irritating as time went on.
- B. rate the listening experience as more negative than those whose listening experience was uninterrupted.
- C. rate the experience of listening to construction noise as lasting for less time than it actually lasted.
- D. perceive the volume of the construction noise as growing softer over time.

#### ID: ce4448b7 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. It most logically completes the text. The text tells us that disruptions to an enjoyable experience increase viewers' enjoyment. It also says that researchers suspect the opposite is true for disruptions to an unpleasant experience. Thus, we can infer that the researchers expect to find that the interrupted unpleasant experience was worse for listeners than the uninterrupted unpleasant experience.

Choice A is incorrect. It doesn't logically complete the text never makes any claims about how irritating the disruptions themselves are perceived to be. Rather, the text says that pleasant experiences are perceived as more enjoyable with interruptions, and that the opposite is suspected to be true of unpleasant experiences. Choice C is incorrect. It doesn't logically complete the text never makes any claims about how long any experience is perceived to be. Rather, the text says that pleasant experiences are perceived as more enjoyable with interruptions, and that the opposite is suspected to be true of unpleasant experiences. Choice D is incorrect. It doesn't logically complete the text never makes any claims about how interruptions affect the perceived volume of the unpleasant experience. Rather, the text says that pleasant experiences are perceived as more enjoyable with interruptions, and that the opposite is suspected to be true of unpleasant experiences.

3.3

German theater practitioner Bertolt (1898–1956) believed that theater should elicit an intellectual rather than an emotional response from audiences, provoking them to consider social and political realities that extend beyond the characters and events depicted onstage. Brecht's influence can be seen in English playwright Caryl Churchill's 1979 play Cloud 9: although the play sometimes invites empathetic reactions, it primarily works to engage audiences in an interrogation of patriarchy and colonialism, which it does by placing audiences at a distance, thereby encouraging them to _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. focus on the characters' beliefs about social and political issues as revealed by the characters' actions.
- B. reflect on social and political phenomena not directly related to patriarchy and colonialism.
- C. recognize pertinent social and political parallels between Germany during Brecht's time and England at the time when Churchill was writing Cloud 9.
- D. be dispassionate as they think critically about the social and political questions raised by the play.

ID: f9bd4e61 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. Churchill's play was influenced by Brecht's belief that theater should elicit an intellectual rather than an emotional response from audiences, making them think about social and political issues that also exist outside of the play. Therefore, it makes sense that Churchill would strive to have audiences think dispassionately (i.e., without emotion) and critically about the social and political questions raised by the play.

Choice A is incorrect. The passage mentions that Churchill was influenced by Brecht's belief that plays should provoke audience members "to consider social and political realities that extend beyond the characters and events depicted onstage" so there's no basis for an inference about audience members deeply engaging with characters' beliefs and actions. Choice B is incorrect. Reflecting on things that aren't related to patriarchy and colonialism wouldn't "engage audiences in an interrogation of patriarchy and colonialism." That creates a confusing contradiction. Choice C is incorrect. No mention is made of social and political issues in Germany during Brecht's time, so there's no basis for this inference.

3.4

Archaeologists and historians used to believe that the Maya civilization during its Classic period (roughly 250– 900) lacked agricultural marketplaces. One reason for this belief was that these scholars misunderstood the ecology of the regions the Maya inhabited. Marketplaces typically emerge because different individuals or groups want to trade resources they control for resources they don't control. Scholars seriously underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya landscape and thus assumed that

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. marketplaces likely would not have attracted many traders from outside the regions controlled by the Maya.
- B. farming practices would have been largely the same throughout Maya lands even if the crops people produced varied significantly.
- C. marketplaces would not have enabled Maya people to acquire many products different from those they already produced.
- D. farmers would trade agricultural products only if they had already produced enough to meets.

#### ID: 4889580c Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text's discussion of scholars' understanding of Maya ecology and agricultural marketplaces. The text indicates that scholars used to believe that during the Classic period, the Maya civilization didn't have agricultural marketplaces. According to the text, scholars held this view because they misunderstood the ecology of areas where the Maya lived. The text points out that people tend to create marketplaces in order to acquire resources they don't otherwise control. Agricultural marketplaces would have allowed farmers who produced one type of crop to trade that crop for other types of crops that they didn't produce. The text goes on to say, however, that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya areas, meaning that scholars thought that the Maya landscape produced a smaller range of resources than it actually produced. Taken together, then, this information suqqests that scholars assumed that marketplaces wouldn't have allowed Maya people to acquire products different from the products they already produced: that is, if everyone produced the same array of crops, as scholars mistakenly believed, then there wouldn't have been any need for marketplaces where people could trade those crops.

Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't say anything about trade between the Maya and people from outside the regions controlled by the Maya. Although scholars' mistaken belief that the Maya lands weren't very ecologically diverse would give those scholars a reason to think that the Maya didn't have marketplaces, it wouldn't lead scholars to assume that traders from outside Maya lands were uninterested in acquiring resources produced by the Maya. Even if the Maya actually did produce only a small array of resources

{5}------------------------------------------------

throughout their lands, there is no reason to believe from the text that people outside Maya lands also produced these same resources and thus would have no need to trade with the Maya people. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya lands, which suggests that they mistakenly believed that the Maya produced a relatively small array of resources throughout their territory, not that the crops the Maya produced varied significantly throughout the Maya lands. Although the scholars might have assumed that a lack of ecological diversity suggests that Maya farming practices were largely the same everywhere, the text does not support that they also assumed there was a lot of variation in the crops that Maya people produced. In fact, the text states that marketplaces emerge when people want to obtain resources they don't already control. If it were the case that scholars assumed that the crops Maya people produced varied significantly, this would have led them to conclude that Maya people likely established marketplaces so they could trade for resources they didn't already possess, not that the Maya civilization lacked marketplaces. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suqqests that scholars assumed that farmers wouldn't trade their agricultural products unless they had already met their own needs with those products. Instead, the text says that scholars thought that the Maya lands produced a smaller array of resources than they actually did, which the text suqqests led scholars to assume that the Maya didn't have any need for marketplaces. The scholars' mistaken belief has no bearing on the issue of whether farmers met their own needs before trading their products.

3.5

Scientists studying Mars long thought the history of its crust was relatively simple. One reason for this is that geologic and climate data collected by a spacecraft showed that the crust was largely composed of basalt, likely as a result of intense volcanic activity that brought about a magma ocean, which then cooled to form the planet's surface. A study led by Valerie Payré focused on additional information—further analysis of data collected by the spacecraft and infrared wavelengths detected from Mars's surface—that revealed the presence of surprisingly high concentrations of silica in certain regions on Mars. Since a planetary surface that formed in a mostly basaltic environment would be unlikely to contain large amounts of silica, Payré concluded that

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. the information about silica concentrations collected by the spacecraft is likely more reliable than the silica information gleaned from infrared wavelengths detected from Mars's surface.
- B. high silica concentrations on Mars likely formed from a different process than that which formed the crusts of other planets.
- C. having a clearer understanding of the composition of Mars's crust and the processes by which it formed will provide more insight into how Earth's crust formed.
- D. Mars's crust likely formed as a result of other major geological events in addition to the cooling of a magma ocean.

#### ID: aaddd60f Answer

Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. Cooling magma would create basalt, but "a planetary surface that formed in a mostly basaltic environment would be unlikely to contain large amounts of silica." Since Mars's crust does contain large amounts of silica, it is unlikely that Mars's crust was formed exclusively by cooling magma. Therefore, there were likely other major geological events that created the high silica concentrations.

Choice A is incorrect. Although the passage discusses these two methods of collecting data about Mars's crust, it never compares their reliability, so there's no basis for this inference. Choice B is incorrect. The passage never mentions anything about the crusts of other planets, so there's no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage never mentions Earth's crust, so there's no basis for this inference.

The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is projected to maintain operation until at least 2030, but it has already revolutionized high-resolution imaging of solar-system bodies in visible and ultraviolet (UV) light wavelengths, notwithstanding that only about 6% of the bodies imaged by the HST are within the solar system. NASA researcher Cindy L. Young and colleagues assert that a new space telescope dedicated exclusively to solarsystem observations would permit an extensive survey of minor solar-system bodies and long-term UV observation to discern how solar-system bodies change over time. Young and colleagues' recommendation therefore implies that the HST __

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. will likely continue to be used primarily to observe objects outside the solar system.
- B. will no longer be used to observe solar system objects if the telescope recommended by Young and colleagues is deployed.
- C. can be modified to observe the features of solar system objects that are of interest to Young and colleagues.
- D. lacks the sensors to observe the wavelengths of light needed to discern how solar system bodies change over time.

#### ID: 08395130 Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The HST will operate until at least 2030, but it's only observing stuff inside our solar system 6% of the time. If we could get a different telescope to observe stuff inside our solar system 100% of the time and take more extensive images of certain things, then the HST could continue to be used mainly for observing stuff outside the solar system.

Choice B is incorrect. This inference is too strong to be supported by the text. Even if the new telescope is deployed, the HST might still be used as it's being used now. Based on the text, the new telescope would just be used for more extensive and long-term imaging of solar system bodies, which doesn't necessarily overlap with the HST Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text never mentions the possibility of modifying the HST, so there is no basis to make this inference. Rather, the researchers suggest using a different telescope to more closely observe certain objects. Choice D is incorrect. This inference is too strong to be supported. The text doesn't give us enough info to assume that the HST lacks any particular sensors.

Geoglyphs are large-scale designs of lines or shapes created in a natural landscape. The Nazca Lines were created in the Nazca Desert in Peru by several Indigenous civilizations over a period of many centuries. Peruvian archaeologist Johny Isla specializes in these geoglyphs. At a German exhibit about the Nazca Lines, he saw an old photograph of a large geoglyph of a whalelike figure and was surprised that he didn't recognize it. Isla returned to Peru and used a drone to search a wide area, looking for the air. This approach suggests that Isla thought that if he hadn't already seen it, the whalelike geoglyph _

Which choice most logically completes the text?

A. must represent a species of whale that went extinct before there were any people in Peru.

B. is actually located in Germany, not Peru, and isn't part of the Nazca Lines at all.

- C. is probably in a location Isla hadn't ever come across while on the ground.
- D. was almost certainly created a long time after the other Nazca Lines geoglyphs were created.

### ID: cef77aa7 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Johny Isla and the whalelike geoglyph. The text indicates that the German exhibit about the Nazca Lines included a photograph showing a whalelike geoglyph that Isla hadn't known about before attending the exhibit, even though Isla "specializes in" Nazca Lines geoglyphs. Given his expertise, and his surprise at being unfamiliar with the whale glyph, the text strongly suggests that Isla believed he would have noticed the qlyph if he had been to its location. Thus, the text implies that the whalelike geoglyph is likely in a location Isla had not previously been to.

Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't address either the species of whale that the geoglyph is meant to represent or its relationship to the earliest humans in the area that is now Peru. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the photograph of the whalelike geoglyph was on display at a "German exhibit," that exhibit was specifically "about the Nazca Lines" which the text indicates are located in Peru. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that the glyphs were created "over a period of many centuries," the text doesn't address when in that period of time any particular glyphs were created.

Indigenous cultures possess unique knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants. According to a 2021 study, 73 percent of the medicinal uses of plants native to North America are reflected in the vocabulary of a single Indigenous language. However, as more and more Indigenous people exclusively speak a globally dominant language, such as English, their ancestral languages fade from daily use. These facts lend added importance to tribal nations' efforts to preserve their languages.

Which choice most logically completes the text?

A. increasing the number of medicinal plants represented in the vocabularies of Indigenous languages.

- B. transmitting terms for medicinal plants from Indigenous languages to globally dominant languages.
- C. preserving knowledge about the medicinal value of plants native to the tribal nations' lands.
- D. ensuring that citizens of tribal nations have physical access to medicinal plants.

#### ID: 2a075bd1 Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the relationship between Indigenous languages and knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants. The text states that Indigenous cultures possess special knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants, which is reflected in their vocabulary. The text then discusses how tribal nations are working to preserve their languages, whose daily use is declining as qlobally dominant lanquaqes become increasingly dominant in Indigenous communities. Given that the languages of tribal nations in what is now the United States function as repositories of knowledge about plants' medicinal uses, it logically follows that continued use of those languages will assist with passing on knowledge about the medicinal value of plants native to the tribal nations' lands.

Choice A is incorrect because the text states that preserving Indiqenous languages will increase the knowledge, not the number, of medicinal plants. Choice B is incorrect because the text is concerned with how vocabulary about the medicinal value of plants can be preserved through the continued daily use of Indigenous languages, not with how such vocabulary can be incorporated into globally dominant, non-Indigenous languages. Moreover, the text explains that the exclusive use of globally dominant languages in Indigenous communities comes at an expense to the continued daily use of those communities' languages. Given this relationship, it is unlikely globally dominant languages would borrow Indigenous vocabulary pertaining to plants' medicinal uses. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't discuss physical access to medicinal plants, instead focusing on Indiqenous knowledge and lanquage surrounding the medicinal uses of plants.

Laura Mulvey has theorized that in narrative film, shots issuing from a protagonist's point of viewers to identify with the character. Such identification is heightened by "invisible editing," or editing so inconspicuous that it renders cuts between shots almost unnoticeable. Conversely, Mulvey proposes that conspicuous editing or an absence of point-of-view shots would induce a more critical stance toward a protagonist. Consider, for example, the attic scene in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, a conspicuously edited sequence of tens of shots, few of which correspond to the protagonist's point of view. According to Mulvey's logic, this scene should affect viewers by __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Which choice most logically completes the text?

A. obscuring their awareness of the high degree of artifice involved in constructing the montage.

- B. lessening their identification with the protagonist, if not alienating them from the character altogether.
- C. compelling them to identify with the film's director, whose proxy is the camera, and not with the protagonist.
- D. diverting their attention away from the film's content and toward its stylistic attributes.

#### ID: 95dbdf51 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. We're told that point-of-view shots and "invisible editing" make audiences identify with a character. We're also told that obvious editing and a lack of point-of-view shots have the opposite effect. Since the sequence in The Birds falls into this second category, it should have the effect of reducing the audience's connection with the protagonist.

Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention viewers' awareness of artifice (i.e., camera trickery) in films, so there's no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention the director at all, so there's no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. The passage doesn't discuss whether a film's "stylistic attributes" may distract viewers from the film's story, so there's no basis for this inference.

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. It most logically completes the text says that some scientists can't explain why prolonged deep sleep is so widespread, given that the known benefits of sleep to make up for how vulnerable it leaves an animal. This suggests that prolonged deep sleep probably has unknown evolutionary benefits that make up for the vulnerability.

Choice B is incorrect. It doesn't logically complete the text. The text only discusses the benefits and risks of one trait: sleep. So there's no basis for an inference about "most traits." Choice C is incorrect. It doesn't logically complete the text. The text says that it is already known that prolonged deep is widespread in the animal kingdom. Rather, what some scientists can't explain is WHY prolonged deep sleep is so widespread, given that the known benefits of sleep don't seem to make up for how vulnerable it leaves an animal.

Researchers Suchithra Rajendran and Maximilian Popfinger modeled varying levels of passenger redistribution from short-haul flights (flights of 50 to 210 minutes, from takeoff to landing) to high-speed rail trips. Planes travel faster than trains, but air travel typically requires 3 hours of lead time for security, baggage handling, and boarding that rail travel doesn't, so short-haul routes take similar amounts of time by rail. However, the model suggests that as rail passenger volumes approach current capacity limits, long lead times emerge. Therefore, for rail to remain a viable alternative to short-haul flights, ___________________________________________________________________________________________________

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. rail systems should offer fewer long-haul routes and airlines should offer more long-haul routes.
- B. rail systems may need to schedule additional trains for these routes.
- C. security, baggage handling, and boarding procedures used by airlines may need to be implemented for rail systems.
- D. passengers who travel by rail for these routes will need times will be similar to those for air travel.

### ID: f942646f Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. Air travel usually requires much more "lead time" than train travel, so short flights end up taking the same amount of time as a train trip to the same destination. But train travel starts to need more "lead time" when the trains approach their capacity limits. This suggests that train companies should add more trains for these routes if they want to encourage travelers to take a train instead of a plane.

Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text never discusses "long-haul routes" for either air travel or rail travel, so there is no basis to make this inference. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text only mentions these procedures to explain why the "lead time" is so long for air travel. It never suggests that trains need to start implementing these procedures too. Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The goal is to make sure that trains "remain a viable alternative" to short flights, which suggests that anything that makes train travel take longer should be avoided.

A. risk judging Tanner's painting by standards that may not be historically appropriate.

- B. tend to conflate Tanner's political views with those of his contemporaries.
- C. forgo analyzing Tanner's painting in favor of analyzing his political activity.
- D. wrongly assume that Tanner's painting was intended as a critique of his fellow artists.

### ID: 0dccbf17 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. It most logically completes the text argues that Tanner and his contemporaries may have been unfamiliar with modern beliefs and values. This suggests that scholars who attribute those modern values to Tanner's painting are risking judging the painting by standards that are not historically accurate.

Choice B is incorrect. It doesn't logically complete the text argues that Tanner AND his contemporaries may have been unfamiliar with modern views. It never suqqests that Tanner's views were different from his contemporaries' views. Choice C is incorrect. It doesn't logically complete the text. The text never suggests that scholars should analyze Tanner's political activity instead of his painting. Rather, the text argues that Tanner and his contemporaries may have been unfamiliar with modern beliefs and values. Choice D is incorrect. It doesn't logically complete the text. The text never suggests that Tanner wanted to critigue his contemporaries with his painting. Rather, the text argues that Tanner AND his contemporaries may have been unfamiliar with modern beliefs and values.

A heliograph is a semaphore device used for sending optical communications-usually in the form of Morse code —by reflecting flashes of sunlight off a mirror. Heliographs were used for rapid communication across expansive distances for military, surveying, and forestry purposes during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but they were largely effective only during the daytime, and the range of the device depended on factors such as the opacity of the air and line of sight. Therefore, heliographs were eventually replaced by technology that _

Which choice most logically completes the text?

A. worked on similar principles but was easier to produce and maintain.

- B. was not so constrained by environmental circumstances.
- C. could be used for more than military, surveying, or forestry purposes.
- D. enabled communication that didn't require knowledge of Morse code.

### ID: 61228830 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The passage explains that heliographs "were largely effective only during the daytime" and that "the range of the device depended on factors such as the opacity of the air and line of sight." These constraints would have oreatly limited the use of the heliograph, so we can infer that this would have been a reason to replace it with new technology.

Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn't discuss the production and maintenance of heliographs, so there's no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention any "other purposes" that a heliograph wouldn't work for, so there's no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention knowledge of Morse code as a particular problem with the use of heliographs, so there's no basis for this inference.

Tides can deposit large quantities of dead vegetation within a salt marsh, smothering healthy plants and leaving a salt panne—a depression devoid of plants that tends to trap standing water—in the marsh's interior. Ecologist Kathryn Beheshti and colleagues found that burrowing crabs living within these pannes improve drainage by loosening the soil, leading the pannes to shrink as marsh plants move back in. At salt marsh edges, however, crab-induced soil loosening can promote marsh loss by accelerating erosion, suggesting that the burrowing action of crabs __

Which choice most logically completes the text?

A. can be beneficial to marshes with small pannes but can be harmful to marshes with large pannes.

B. may promote increases in marsh plants or decreases in marsh plants, depending on the crabs' location.

C. tends to be more heavily concentrated in areas of marsh interiors with standing water than at marsh edges.

D. varies in intensity depending on the size of the panne relative to the surrounding marsh.

#### ID: d1539546 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The text says that crab burrowing in the pannes enables plants to grow there again. It also says that crab burrowing at the edges of the marsh speeds up marsh loss. This suggests that burrowing crabs can either help or hurt marshes, depending on where they're located.

Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text never discusses pannes of different sizes. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text never suggests that crabs do more burrowing in the pannes (the areas with standing water) than they do at the edges. Rather, the text says that the burrowing that happens in the pannes is beneficial, while the burrowing that happens at the edges is harmful. Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text never discusses the intensity of crab burrowing, nor does it discuss the size of the panne relative to the size of the marsh.

"Gestures" in painting are typically thought of as bold, expressive brushstrokes. In the 1970s, American painter Jack Whitten built a 12-foot (3.7-meter) tool he named the "developer" to apply paint to an entire canvas in one motion, resulting in his series of "slab" paintings from that decade. Whitten described this process as making an entire painting in "one gesture," signaling a clear departure from the prevalence of gestures in his work from the 1960s. Some art historians claim this shift represents "removing gesture" from the process. Therefore, regardless of whether using the developer constitutes a gesture, both Whitten and these art historians likely agree that

Which choice most logically completes the text?

A. any tool that a painter uses to create an artwork is capable of creating gestures.

- B. Whitten's work from the 1960s exhibits many more gestures than his work from the 1970s does.
- C. Whitten became less interested in exploring the role of gesture in his work as his career progressed.
- D. Whitten's work from the 1960s is much more realistic than his work from the 1970s is.

ID: 9abc3ba5 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. Whitten thinks the tool made "one gesture" paintings, while historians think the tool "removed gesture" from the process completely. But putting that debate aside, both Whitten and the historians would agree that the paintings he made with the '70s have way fewer gestures than his paintings from the '60s, in which gestures are "prevalent," meaning widely and extensively present.

Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text only discusses the "developer"—it never mentions other tools. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. If anything, the text suggests the opposite: that Whitten became more interested in exploring the role of gesture in his work as his career progressed, as his earlier paintings had many gestures, and his '70s paintings only had "one gesture." Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn't supported. The text never discusses the "realism" of Whitten's art.

During the Bourbon Restoration in France (1814–1830), the right to vote required in part that a person paid at least 300 francs in direct taxes to the government. The four most common taxes (the quatre vieilles) were levied on real estate (both land and buildings); the doors and windows in taxpayer homes; the rental values of homes; and the businesses of artisans and merchants. (Foreign investments were either exempt from taxed lightly.) Although relatively few people paid the tax on real estate, it was the main means of voter qualification and accounted for over two-thirds of government receipts during this period, suggesting that during the Bourbon Restoration _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Which choice most logically completes the text?

A. those people who had the right to vote most likely had substantial holdings of French real estate.

B. the voting habits of French artisans and merchants were effective in reducing tax burdens ses.

C. the number of doors and windows in French residences was kept to a minimum but increased after 1830.

D. French people with significant foreign investments were unlikely to have the right to vote.

#### ID: 22b3da87 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. We're told that people needed to pay "at least 300 francs in direct taxes" to be able to vote. We're also told that, while "relatively few people paid the tax on real estate," real estate taxes were both the main way people qualified to vote and the main source of revenue for the qovernment. Based on this, we can infer that those who did qualify to vote likely had significant French real estate holdings.

Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention the voting habits of artisans and merchants nor any reduction in tax burdens on businesses, so there's no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. Although we know that doors and windows were taxed during the Bourbon Restoration, we don't have enough information to infer if doors and windows increased after this time. Choice D is incorrect. Although we know that foreign investments were only minimally taxed, we don't have enough information to determine if those with significant foreign investments were unlikely to have voting rights. For example, it's possible that those with significant foreign investments were likely to also be people with significant domestic investments which they did pay taxes on, so we don't have the information necessary to make this inference.

Mosses can struggle in harsh desert conditions because these plants require enough sunlight for photosynthesis but not so much that they risk drying out. Researchers Jenna Ekwealor and Kirsten M. Fisher found several species of Syntrichia caninervis, a type of desert moss, growing under quartz crystals in California's Mojave Desert. To evaluate whether these semitransparent rocks benefited the moss, the researchers compared the shoot tissue, a measure of plant growth, of S. caninervis when growing on the soil surface versus when the moss was growing under the quartz rocks. They found that the shoot tissue was 62% longer for moss growing under the quartz as compared to moss on the soil surface, suggesting that _

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. S. caninervis is one of the few types of moss that can survive under semitransparent rocks.
- B. quartz crystals do not transmit the necessary sunlight for photosynthesis in S. caninervis.
- C. S. caninervis growing under quartz crystals experience lower light intensity and are thus able to retain more moisture.
- D. quartz crystals are capable of supporting S. caninervis growth if the crystals are not too thin.

#### ID: cae97f58 Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text explains that while desert moss species need sufficient sunlight for photosynthesis, exposure to sunlight can also affect the plants neqatively by drying them out. Ekwealor and Fisher's team found specimens of S. caninervis moss growing under quartz crystals that were semitransparent, allowing some but not all sunlight to pass through them, and the shoot tissue of these specimens was longer than that of S. caninervis specimens found growing on the surface that were unprotected by such crystals. Since, as the text explains, the length of shoot tissue is an indicator of plant growth, and since greater exposure to sunlight results in greater loss of moisture, it can be inferred that S. caninervis growing under quartz crystals experience lower light intensity and are thus able to retain more moisture.

Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't mention another moss species besides S. caninervis or discuss whether other such species are able to grow under transparent crystals, as S. caninervis is. Choice B is incorrect because, as the text explains, specimens of S. caninervis were found growing under quartz crystals and exhibited more plant growth than specimens growing on the soil surface. This wouldn't have been the case if the crystals transmitted insufficient light for the moss's photosynthesis. Choice D is incorrect. The text contrasts the growth of S. caninervis specimens found beneath semitransparent quartz crystals with that of specimens found on the soil surface absent such crystals, but it doesn't make a comparison among specimens

To better understand the burrowing habits of Alpheus bellulus (the tiger pistol shrimp), some studies have used resin casting to obtain precise measurements of the shrimps' burrows. Resin casting involves completely filling an empty burrow with a liquid plastic that hardens to create a three-dimensional model; however, recovering the model inevitably requires destroying the burrow. In their 2022 study, Miyu Umehara and colleagues discovered that an x-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner can accurately record a burrow's measurements both at a moment in time and throughout the entire burrow-building process, something that's impossible with resin casting because ____________

Which choice most logically completes the text?

- A. it can only be used on burrows below a certain size.
- B. it does not allow for multiple castings of the same burrow over time.
- C. the casting process takes more time than A. bellulus takes to construct a burrow.
- D. the process of recovering the model distorts the resin's shape.

#### ID: 03701ef3 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. Since resin casting "inevitably requires destroying the burrow," it would be impossible to make multiple castings of the same burrow over time.

Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn't discuss size requirements for completing resin casting, so there's no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage never mentions how long the casting process takes nor how long A. bellulus takes to construct a borrow, so there's no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. The passage never states that recovering the model distorts the resin's shape, only that it destroys the burrow. Therefore, there's no basis for this inference.

Conventional theories of rhetoric hold that presenting information as coming from credentialed experts increases that information's credibility. When communications researcher Sungkyoung Lee and her colleaques tested messages seeking volunteers for clinical trials, however, they found that participants in their study judged recruitment messages from former trial volunteers as significantly more credible than messages from doctors (i.e., credentialed experts). One reason for this may be that the doctors' status as credentialed experts was outweighed by participants' views of the experiential relevance of the two types of messengers; that is, participants may have reacted the way they did because

Which choice most logically completes the text?

messages from former trial volunteers depicted clinical trials as being more positive experiences than did messages A. from doctors.

participants did not have enough experience to evaluate the credibility of the doctors' messages but did have enough B. experience to evaluate the credibility of former trial volunteers' messages.

participants regarded the experiences of both the doctors and former trial volunteers as relevant to the subject of clinical D. trials but were skeptical of the doctors' status as credentialed experts.

### ID: 5d20f560 Answer

Correct Answer: C

{23}------------------------------------------------

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text's discussion of how participants considered messages from former trial volunteers and doctors. The text first establishes that information coming from credentialed experts typically increases the credibility of that information. However, the text goes on to describe a situation that goes against this expectation: the messages from previous trial volunteers were judged as more credible than the messages from licensed doctors when recruiting clinic trial participants. The text then goes on to speculate as to why this may have been the case, stating that participants likely considered the messages from the former trial volunteers to be more convincing than the messages the former trial volunteers were perceived as having undergone the same experience that the participants were considering. It is reasonable to infer, that participants reqarded the former trial volunteers' direct experience as more important to their decision-making than the doctors' status as credentialed experts.

Choice A is incorrect because the text does not provide any indication as to the content or the messages provided by either the doctors or the former trial volunteers reqarding the clinical trials. Choice B is incorrect. Since the study participants had not themselves participated in the clinical trial, they could not rely on their experience to evaluate the credibility of either the former trial volunteers or the doctors. While the text does establish that the participants likely considered the messages from both the doctors and the former trial volunteers, it does not suggest that the participants doubted the doctors' credentials. Rather, the text speculates that participants may have given the experiences of the former trial volunteers more importance than the doctors' credentials when considering the recruitment messages.

During their larval phase, numerous species of coral reef fish are drawn toward areas where light is present. To better understand how artificial light at night (ALAN) might affect some coral reef fish, researchers explored the effect of exposure to low levels of ALAN on the reproductive success of the common clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris). While exposure to low levels of ALAN had no significant effect on spawning frequency and egg fertilization in the presence of ALAN completely inhibited hatching. These findings suggest that _

Which choice most logically completes the text?

A. ocellaris that settle in areas with low levels of ALAN have significantly higher rates of successful egg fertilization than A. A. ocellaris that settle in areas without ALAN do.

the reproductive success of A. ocellaris would be at risk if they were to selectively settle in regions that are regularly B. exposed to low levels of ALAN.

the reproductive success of A. ocellaris is more greatly affected by the presence of low levels of ALAN during incubation C. than the reproductive success of other species of coral reef fish is.

the spawning frequency of A. ocellaris was more strongly affected by the presence of ALAN than egg D. fertilization was, though both were less affected than incubation.

### ID: 5cd55c77 Answer

#### Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of artificial light at night (ALAN) and the common clownlish (A. ocellaris). The text indicates that researchers found that when A. ocellaris is exposed to low levels of ALAN, spawning frequency and egg fertilization aren't significantly affected but hatching is completely inhibited –that is, the eggs never hatch. Therefore, if A. ocellaris were to settle only in regions where the fish would be reqularly exposed to low levels of ALAN, their eggs would stop hatching and their reproductive success would be at risk.

Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that exposure to low levels of ALAN had no significant effect on egg fertilization for A. ocellaris, so there's no reason to expect there would be any significant difference in rates of successful egg fertilization between areas with low levels of ALAN and areas without ALAN. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't discuss the particular effects of low levels of ALAN on any species of coral reef fish besides . For this reason, there's no support in the idea that the reproductive success of A. ocellaris is more greatly affected by the presence of low levels of ALAN than the reproductive success of coral reef fish is. Choice D is incorrect. The text does indicate that A. ocellaris incubation was most strongly affected by low levels of ALAN, but it doesn't indicate that there was a greater effect on spawning frequency than on egg fertilization; in fact, the text states that there was no significant effect on either.

Overgrazing by purple sea urchins has caused many kelp forests along North America's west coast to be replaced by urchin barrens-areas stripped of veqetation and covered in purple sea urchins. Urchins in barrens persist in a state of starvation that lessens their nutritional value-and thus their appeal-to many predators. Sarah Gravem and colleagues placed sunflower sea stars, a once-abundant predator species suffering massive population declines in recent years, in aquariums that each contained a nutritionally poor and a nutritionally rich purple sea urchin. The researchers found that the sea stars selected the nutritionally rich urchin in 42.7% of trials and the nutritionally poor urchin in 37.5% of trials, suggesting that

Which choice most logically completes the text?

sunflower sea stars are willing to hunt sea urchins, but if given a choice, they will prey on other more nutritious marine A. animals instead.

sunflower sea stars are reluctant to feed on both nutritionally rich sea urchins and are therefore B. unlikely to thrive in kelp forests.

sunflower sea stars are less likely to consume sea urchins in barrens than other species of sea stars are, putting C. sunflower sea stars at a high risk of extinction.

sunflower sea stars do not always avoid foraging on nutritionally poor sea urchins, making sunflower sea star population D. recovery a potentially important tool for controlling urchin barrens.

### ID: e6e6be2d Answer

Correct Answer: D

{26}------------------------------------------------

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text's discussion of the researchers' findings about purple sea urchins and sunflower sea stars. The text explains that urchin barrens are areas that used to be kelp forests but are now covered by purple sea urchins. The text suqgests that because there is no more vegetation to be consumed in those areas, the urchins exist in a state of starvation that makes them less nutritional for many predators. The text goes on to explain that in a study with a choice between two purple sea stars (a predator species that has been substantially declining) consumed a nutritionally rich urchin 42.7% of the time and a nutritionally poor urchin 37.5% of the time. Because the sunflower sea stars didn't always avoid consuming nutritionally poor urchins, even when nutritionally rich ones were available, it follows that helping sunflower sea star populations to grow could help control urchin barrens by increasing the number of sea stars that may consume and thus remove nutritionally poor purple sea urchins from barrens.

Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates only that when presented with purple sea stars in the study consumed both nutritionally poor ones. It doesn't suggest that sunflower sea stars generally prefer other marine animals that are more nutritious; there's no mention of other marine animals. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that sunflower sea stars are generally reluctant to feed on sea urchins. In fact, the text indicates that the sunflower sea stars in the study did consume sea urchins, feeding on both nutritionally poor and nutritionally rich ones. Choice C is incorrect because the text addresses only the willingness of sunflower sea stars to consume the type of sea urchins found in barrens (nutritionally poor sea urchins), not how likely other species of sea stars are to consume them.

In a three-year study of parasitic infections by Anomotaenia brevis tapeworms in Temnothorax nylanderi ants, entomologist Susanne Foitzik and colleagues found something unexpected: rather than reducing its host's fitness, as is typical of parasites, A. brevis greatly extends the lifespan of a T. nylanderi worker ant and seems to halt the effects of aging. Furthermore, those infected receive special treatment, ceasing their share of labor to sustain the colony and remaining in the nest as uninfected workers feed, groom, and transport them. By contrast, the researchers observed that uninfected workers in parasitized colonies have shortened lifespans, most likely because the _

high level of activity maintained by the uninfected workers makes them infected workers to quickly C. disperse when the nest is attacked by a predator.

average lifespan of T. nylanderi worker ants in colonies without parasitic activity typically falls well below three years, the D. range covered by the study.

### ID: 1bf2173e Answer

Correct Answer: B

{28}------------------------------------------------

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The text describes a study examining the relationship between a species of parasitic tapeworm, A. brevis, and its host insect, the T. nylander ant. According to the text, researchers were surprised to find that the tapeworm extends the life of its ant host, rather than reducing it. The text goes on to state that the infected ants end up doing less work to sustain the colony and that as a result, the uninfected ants ' share of labor in addition to caring for them in their infected state. The study's researchers also observed that the uninfected ants have shorter lifespans than expected. If the infected ants, who are doing less work in the colony, have longer lifespans, it can be inferred that the less an ant works, the longer it will live. The opposite of this statement can also be inferred: the more an ant works, the shorter its life. So, since the workload within the colony is being redistributed so that the infected ants work less while the uninfected ants work more (as they take on the neglected duties of the infected ants and also care for those ants), then it can be inferred that the lifespans of the uninfected ants are shortened because the need to ceduced contributions within the colony while also caring for infected workers is burdensome to the uninfected workers.

Choice A is incorrect because the text does not indicate how A. brevis is transmitted to the ants or assert that uninfected ants are more likely to be directly exposed to A. brevis while caring for infected ants. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the relative abilities of infected ants to escape predators: in fact, predators are not mentioned in the text at all. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not supply any information about the average lifespans of the ants in colonies without parastic activity; the text only indicates factors that lengthen and shorten the lifespans of ants in parasitized colonies.
