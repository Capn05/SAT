Classical composer Florence Price's 1927 move to Chicago marked a turning point in her career. It was there that Price premiered her First Symphony-a piece that was praised for blending traditional Romantic motifs with aspects of Black folk music-and _________________________________ supportive relack artists.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. developing
- B. developed
- C. to develop
- D. having developed

### ID: b74f676f Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The missing verb is part of the same clause as the verb "premiered," and "Price" is the subject of both. So we need the past-tense form "developed" in order to match "premiered."

Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a verb form error. The missing verb is part of the same clause as the verb "premiered," and "Price" is the subject of both. So we need the past-tense form "developed" in order to match "premiered." Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a verb form error. The missing verb is part of the same clause as the verb "premiered," and "Price" is the subject of both. So we need the past-tense form "developed" in order to match "premiered."

Far from being modern inventions, __________________ more than 5,000 years ago.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. Sumerians in ancient Mesopotamia used drinking straws
- B. drinking straws were used by Sumerians in ancient Mesopotamia
- C. the use of drinking straws by Sumerians in ancient Mesopotamia happened
- D. ancient Mesopotamia was home to Sumerians who used drinking straws

#### ID: 684b8bd2 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The modifier "far from being modern inventions" must be describing "drinking straws," because those are the only possible inventions in this sentence.

Choice A is incorrect. Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The modifier "far from being modern inventions" can't be describing "Sumerians" because they are a group of people, not an invention. Choice C is incorrect. Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The modifier "far from being modern inventions" can't be describing "the use of drinking straws," because it is not "the use" of drinking straws that is an invention—it is the drinking straws themselves. Choice D is incorrect. Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The modifier "far from being modern inventions" can't be describing "Ancient Mesopotamia," because that is a place, not an invention.

The human brain is primed to recognize faces—so much so that, due to a perceptual tendency called pareidolia, will even find faces in clouds, wooden doors, pieces of fruit, and other faceless inanimate objects. Researcher Susan Magsamen has focused her work on better understanding this everyday phenomenon.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. she

B. they

C. it

D. those

ID: c52652c9 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. "It" is a singular pronoun used to stand in for objects. Since the antecedent in this case is the singular noun phrase "the human brain," "it" is a perfect pronoun to use here.

Choice A is incorrect. Although "she" is a singular pronoun, it is reserved for people and animals, not objects like "the human brain." Choice B is incorrect. "They" is a plural pronoun, but we need a singular pronoun to represent the antecedent "the human brain." Choice D is incorrect. "Those" is a plural pronoun, but we need a singular pronoun to represent the antecedent "the human brain."

Official measurements of the Mississippi River's length vary: according to the US Geologic Survey, the river is 2,300 miles long, whereas the Environmental Protection Agency records its length as 2,320 miles. This disparity can be explained in part by the fact that rivers such as the Mississippi expand and contract as _____________________________________________________________________________ sediment.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. they accumulate
- B. one accumulates
- C. it accumulates
- D. we accumulate

### ID: 36944347 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The noun that goes with "expand and contract" is "rivers" a plural noun. "They" is a third-person plural pronoun, so it can correctly stand in for "rivers."

Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a pronoun-antecedent agreement error. "One" is a singular pronoun, but the noun that goes with "expand and contract" is "rivers" a plural noun. Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a pronoun-antecedent agreement error. "It" is a singular pronoun, but the noun that goes with "expand and contract" is "rivers," a plural noun. Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a pronoun-antecedent agreement error. The noun that goes with "expand and contract" is the plural noun "rivers." Rivers are not people, so "we" can't be used to stand in for it.

Slam poet Elizabeth Acevedo's debut novel The Poet X, winner of the 2018 National Book Award for Young People's Literature, is composed of __________________________ protagonist, fifteen-yeatista.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. poems putatively written by the novel's

- B. poem's putatively written by the novel's
- C. poem's putatively written by the novels'
- D. poems putatively written by the novels'

### ID: 8d53e7a0 Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. Nothing belongs to the "poems" in the sentence, so it should not be possessive just a simple plural noun. The protagonist does belong to the protagonist of the novel—so "novel" needs to be a singular possessive noun.

Choice B is incorrect. This doesn't complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. This choice uses the singular possessive "poem's," but the text indicates that it should be the simple plural "poems": there is more than one poem, and nothing belongs to the poems. Choice C is incorrect. This doesn't complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. This choice uses the singular possessive "poem's" but the text indicates that it should be the simple plural "poems": there is more than one poem, and nothing belongs to the poems. This choice also uses the plural possessive "novels", which is incorrect because there is only one novel. Choice D is incorrect. This doesn't complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. This choice uses the plural possessive "novels", which is incorrect because there is only one novel, so it should be the singular possessive "novel's." .

Oglala Lakota poet Layli Long Soldier's star quilt poems offer an unusually open-ended reading experience. With eight panels of text stitched together in the shape of a traditional eight-pointed Lakota star quilt, the poems present viewers with a seemingly infinite number of ways to read them.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. their

B. it's

C. they're

D. its

ID: 0bcb4417 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of possessive determiners. The plural possessive determiner "their" agrees in number with the plural noun "the poems," thus indicating that the poems had eight panels of text stitched together in the shape of a traditional eight-pointed Lakota star quilt.

Choice B is incorrect because "it's" is the contraction for "it is" or "it has," not a possessive determiner. Choice C is incorrect because "they're" is the contraction for "they are," not a possessive determiner. Choice D is incorrect because the singular possessive determiner "its" doesn't agree in number with the plural noun "the poems."

Alexander's use of "we" ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ shared desire to seek new opportunity.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. evokes
- B. are evoking
- C. have evoked
- D. evoke

### ID: c8607bdf Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-verb agreement. The singular verb "evokes" agrees in number with the singular subject "Alexander's use."

Choice B is incorrect because the plural verb "are evoking" doesn't agree in number with the singular subject "Alexander's use." Choice C is incorrect because the plural verb "have evoked" doesn't agree in number with the singular subject "Alexander's use." Choice D is incorrect because the plural verb "evoke" doesn't agree in number with the singular subject "Alexander's use."

By the time Hawaiian king Kamehameha III ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ the islands in 1793, had drastically increased, and so too had the need for paniolo (Hawaiian cowboys) to manage the wild herds that then roamed throughout the volcanic terrain.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. ascended
- B. will ascend
- C. ascends
- D. is ascending

## ID: db2e480a Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. "Ascended" is in the simple past tense. Since Kamehameha became king in the past, this makes the most sense.

Choice B is incorrect. "Will ascend" is in the future tense, but we wouldn't know about Kamehameha III's ascent if it hadn't happened yet. The information in the sentence, as well as the tense of other verbs, tells us that the events described happened in the past. Choice C is in the simple present tense. However, the information in the sentence, as well as the tense of other verbs, tells us that the events described happened in the past. Choice D is incorrect. "Is ascending" is in the continuous present tense, which we use to show that something is ongoing, but this doesn't make sense here-the information in the sentence, as well as the tense of other verbs, tells us that the events described happened in the past.

Nuhād al-Haddād, known as Fairuz, was one of the most beloved Lebanese singers of the twentieth century. Her broad singing repertoire-which included traditional forms, such as the Arabic qasida and maqam, alongside modern pop and jazz styles—lent Fairuz a timeless, cross-generational appeal, _ _ _ _ her the moniker "the soul of Lebanon."

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. earned

B. had earned

C. earning

- D. earn
## ID: a30567fd Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The word "earning" is being used to introduce an additional modifying phrase, which describes how Fairuz's repertoire lent her cross-generational appeal. When a verb ends in -ing and doesn't have a helper verb like "is" before it, it can be used to modify a noun or verb. This is appropriate here.

Choice A is incorrect. The underlined verb is being used to introduce additional descriptive information, which is set off from the rest of the sentence by a comma. Because there is no subject here, a finite form of the verb (like "earned") creates an error. We need another form of that doesn't require a subject and can introduce descriptive information. Choice B is incorrect. The underlined verb is being used to introduce additional descriptive information, which is set off from the rest of the sentence by a comma. Because there is no subject here, a finite form of the "had earned") creates an error. We need another form of the verb that doesn't require a subject and can introduce descriptive information. Choice D is incorrect. The underlined verb is being used to introduce additional descriptive information, which is set off from the rest of the sentence by a comma.

A pioneer in the field of taphonomy (the study of how organic remains become fossils), _________ may be just as prevalent in the fossil record as those of thick-shelled organisms.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. fossils of thin-shelled organisms, Anna Behrensmeyer demonstrated in a 2005 analysis,

B. Anna Behrensmeyer demonstrated in a 2005 analysis that fossils of thin-shelled organisms

C. it was demonstrated in a 2005 analysis by Anna Behrensmeyer that fossils of thin-shelled organisms

D. a 2005 analysis—by Anna Behrensmeyer—demonstrated that fossils of thin-shelled organisms

## ID: cd2443c0 Answer

Correct Answer: B

### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-modifier placement. This choice makes the noun phrase "Anna Behrensmeyer" the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phrase "a pioneer…fossils." In doing so, this choice clearly establishes that Anna Behrensmeyer and not another noun in the sentence—is a pioneer in the field of taphonomy.

Choice A is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the noun phrase "fossils of thin-shelled organisms" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that the "fossils" are a pioneer in the field of taphonomy. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the pronoun "it" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that "it" is a pioneer in the field of taphonomy. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the noun phrase "a 2005 analysis" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suqgests that "a 2005 analysis" is a pioneer in the field of taphonomy.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. are taking
- B. have taken
- C. take

### ID: e44db0a0 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-verb agreement. The singular verb "takes" agrees in number with the singular subject "a cycle of lunar phases."

Choice A is incorrect because the plural verb "are taking" doesn't agree in number with the singular subject "a cycle of lunar phases." Choice B is incorrect because the plural verb "have taken" doesn't agree in number with the singular subject "a cycle of lunar phases." Choice C is incorrect because the plural verb "take" doesn't agree in number with the singular subject "a cycle of lunar phases."

After winning the 1860 presidential election, Abraham Lincoln appointed Edward Bates, Salmon P. Chase, and William H. Seward to his cabinet. Lincoln's decision was surprising, since each of these men had run against him, but historians have praised it, noting that Lincoln _______ his rivals' diverse talents to strengthen his administration.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. has leveraged
- B. is leveraging
- C. will leverage
- D. leveraged

### ID: 67614549 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The subject of the verb is "Lincoln," and the first sentence tells us that we're talking about something that Abraham Lincoln did in 1860. So the simple past tense "leveraged" fits the logic of the text.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a tense issue. "Has leveraged" is the present perfect tense, which is used for an action that began in the past and continues into the present. Lincoln started leveraging his rivals' talents in 1860-it's definitely not still happening today. So the present perfect tense isn't appropriate. Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a tense issue. "Is leveraging" is the present tense, but Lincoln leveraged his rivals' talents in 1860, so the present tense isn't appropriate. Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a tense issue. "Will leverage" is the future tense, but Lincoln leveraged his rivals' talents in 1860, so the future tense isn't appropriate.

In knot theory (the mathematical study of curved, closed loops), knots are characterized by their crossing numbers—that is, the number of times the knotted thread crosses over itself. The trefigure-eight knot, each with a crossing number below five, _____ among the simplest possible knots with the fewest number of crossings.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. was

B. are

C. has been

D. is

## ID: 28166dc6 Answer

### Correct Answer: B

## Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-verb agreement. The plural verb "are" agrees in number with the plural compound subject "the trefight knot." The two types of knots joined by "and" function as a plural subject and thus require a plural verb.

Choice A is incorrect because the singular verb "was" doesn't agree in number with the plural compound subject "the trefoil knot and the figure-eight knot." Choice C is incorrect because the singular verb "has been" doesn't agree in number with the plural compound subject "the trefoil knot and the figure-eight knot." Choice D is incorrect because the singular verb "is" doesn't agree in number with the plural compound subject "the trefoil knot and the figure-eight knot."
