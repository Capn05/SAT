While one requires oxygen and one does ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ that is, they are processes by which cells break down glucose to use as energy.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. not aerobic
- B. not. Aerobic
- C. not, aerobic
- D. not; aerobic

### ID: 333b2b65 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. A comma is the appropriate way to link the dependent clause "While…not" and the independent clause that follows.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. "While…not" is a dependent clause, which must be separated from the independent clause that follows with some sort of punctuation. Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a sentence fragment. "While one requires oxygen and one does not" isn't an independent clause, so it can't stand alone as a complete sentence. Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. "While one requires oxygen and one does not" isn't an independent clause, so it can't be linked to the clause that follows with a semicolon.

Human-made (synthetic) fibers used in clothes and many other consumer products are more durable than most natural plant _______ the manufacture of synthetic fibers requires toxic chemical solvents that can pollute air and water.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. fibers,

- B. fibers but
C. fibers

- D. fibers, but
ID: 148be4da Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice correctly uses a comma and the coordinating conjunction "but" to join the first main clause ("Human-made…fibers") and the second main clause ("the manufacture…water").

Choice A is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can't be used in this way to join two main clauses. Choice B is incorrect because when coordinating two longer main clauses such as these, it's conventional to use a comma before the coordinating conjunction. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.

Emperor Ashoka ruled the Maurya Empire in South Asia from roughly 270 to 232 BCE. He is known for enforcing a moral code called the Law of Piety, which established the sanctity of animal _________ the just treatment of the elderly, and the abolition of the slave trade.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. life

B. life;

C. life:

D. life,

ID: 6fece68e Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. Notice that "the sanctity of animal life" is the first item in a list of three things. We must use a comma to separate the first two items in the list, just as a comma is used to separate "the just treatment of the elderly" and "the abolition of the slave trade."

Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. Notice that "the sanctity of animal life" is the first item in a list of three things. To appropriately format the list, we need punctuation to separate each item. Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. Notice that "the sanctity of animal life" is the first item in a list of three things. While semicolons are sometimes used to separate list items, this list uses commas to separate the other list items, and lists must use the same punctuation throughout. Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. Notice that "the sanctity of animal life" is the first item in a list of three things. While colons can be used to introduce lists, they can't be used to separate items within a list.

A subseasonal weather forecast attempts to predict weather conditions three to four weeks in ________________________________________________________________________________ its predictions are therefore more short-term than those of the seasonal forecast, which attempts to predict the weather more than a month in advance.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. advance,
- B. advance
- C. advance;
- D. advance and

### ID: 1724dac2 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The clause "A subseasonal...advance" and the clause "its precast" are both independent clauses, so using a semicolon to separate them is grammatically correct.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The clause "A subseasonal…advance" and the clause "its predictions…forecast" are both independent clauses, so a comma is not enough to separate them. Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The clause "A subseasonal…advance" and the clause "its predictions...forecast" are both independent clauses, so they need to be separated with specific punctuation (a period, a semi-colon, a dash, or a comma + a coordinating conjunction). Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a run-on sentence error. The clause "A subseasonal…advance" and the clause "its predictions…forecast" are both independent clauses, so the word "and" by itself is not enough to separate them. There would need to be a comma before "and" for this choice to work.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. of:

B. of

C. of-

D. of,

ID: a1e0c981 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. "Themes of childhood" is one noun phrase, with "themes of" implicitly carrying over to the other items on the list ("themes of childhood, [themes of] womanhood, and [themes of] Chinese American identity").

Choice A is incorrect. This choice inappropriately breaks up the introduction of a list. Also, "In her book…. themes of" is not an independent clause, thanks to the dangling "of" at the end, so it can't precede a colon. Choice C is incorrect. This choice inappropriately breaks up the introduction of a list. Also, "In her book...themes of" is not an independent clause, thanks to the dangling "of" at the end, so it can't precede a single dash. Choice D is incorrect. This choice inappropriately breaks up the introduction of a list. "Themes of" implicitly carries over to each item on the list ("themes of childhood, [themes of] womanhood, and [themes of] Chinese American identity"), so we don't want to use a comma to separate it.

- A. content and
- B. content,
- C. content
- D. content, and

### ID: b35cefb7 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation between a subordinate clause and a main clause. This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the subordinate clause ("Because...content") and the main clause ("scientists...settlements").

Choice A is incorrect. Joining the subordinate clause ("Because...content") and the clause that follows ("scientists...settlements") with the conjunction "and" results in an ungrammatical sentence that lacks a main clause. Choice C is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the subordinate clause and the main clause with appropriate punctuation. Choice D is incorrect. Joining the subordinate clause ("Because...content") and the clause that follows ("scientists...settlements") with a comma and the conjunction "and" results in an ungrammatical sentence that lacks a main clause.

Psychophysicist Howard Moskowitz was hired by a soda company to determine how much artificial sweetener After conducting consumer taste tests, he found that no such ideal existed: participants expressed a wide range of preferences for different blends of sweetener, carbonization, and flavoring.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. do most people prefer in a diet drink?

- B. do most people prefer in a diet drink.
- C. most people prefer in a diet drink?
- D. most people prefer in a diet drink.

#### ID: aab78b25 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. This sentence is a statement: "Moskowitz was hired by a soda company to determine how much artificial sweetener most people prefer in a diet drink." So a period is the most appropriate punctuation mark.

Choice A is incorrect. This doesn't complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. This sentence is not a question-it's a statement. So a question mark is not the appropriate punctuation. Choice B is incorrect. This doesn't complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. We already have the verbs "was hired...to determine" in this sentence. The verb "do" is not needed and results in a confusing, ungrammatical sentence. Choice C is incorrect. This doesn't complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. This sentence is not a question-it's a statement. So a question mark is not the appropriate punctuation.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. asteroids. Several
- B. asteroids, several
- C. asteroids; several
- D. asteroids: several

#### ID: 26c8c88c Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. This choice uses a comma to correctly separate the dependent clause "although... asteroids" from the independent clause "several hundred have been...Mars."

Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a sentence fraqment. "Although...asteroids" is a dependent clause. It can't stand on its own as a sentence, which means it can't end in a period. Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error. "Although...asteroids" is a dependent clause and can't be joined to the independent clause "several hundred have been...Mars" with a semicolon can only join two independent clauses. Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. A colon can only come after an independent clause, but "although... asteroids" is a dependent clause.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. from:

B. from,

C. from

- D. from-
ID: 89ab0d46 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The word "from" introduces a prepositional phrase that modifies the noun "pages" and provides essential information about their origin. No additional punctuation is needed after "from" in this context.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error, illogically separating the preposition "from" from the rest of the prepositional phrase with a colon. Also, a colon can only follow an independent clause, but what comes before the blank could not stand on its own as a complete sentence. Choice B is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error, illogically separating the preposition "from" from the rest of the prepositional phrase with a comma. Choice D is incorrect.

- A. movement: which
- B. movement, which
- C. movement which
- D. movement. Which

### ID: ea8f4658 Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. This choice correctly uses commas to set off the nonessential relative clause "which is known as Brownian motion" that provides extra information about the "random, continuous movement" that isn't necessary for the function of the sentence.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error. The relative clause "which is known as Brownian motion" is a nonessential supplement. Nonessential supplements need to be set apart from the rest of the sentence with a pair of commas, dashes, or parentheses, so we can't use a colon here. Also, notice that colons can only come after an independent clause, which isn't the case here. Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a punctuation error. The relative clause "which is known as Brownian motion" is a nonessential supplement, so it should be separated from the rest of the sentence by a pair of matching punctuation marks. We already have a comma after "motion," so we need to add a comma before "which." This choice is missing that comma. Choice D is incorrect. This choice results in a sentence fragment. "This type of random, continuous movement" is not an independent clause and can't stand alone as a full sentence, so we can't put a period here.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. movie such

B. movie; such

C. movie. Such

D. movie, such

### ID: c21df211 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The comma appropriately separates the nonessential descriptive aside "such as... scene" from the independent clause "Theaters were...movie." Since the descriptive example of roses isn't necessary for the sentence to function, it needs to be set off with punctuation.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a run-on sentence. Since the example of roses isn't necessary for the sentence to function, the descriptive aside "such as...scene" needs to be separated from the preceding independent clause with some sort of punctuation. Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a punctuation error. A semicolon can only be used to separate two independent clauses, but "such...scene" is not an independent clause and couldn't stand on its own as a sentence. Choice C is incorrect.

- A. themselves;
- B. themselves,
- C. themselves. And
- D. themselves

### ID: 577b09fa Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the punctuation of items in a series. The comma after "themselves" is used conventionally to separate the first item ("they can clone themselves") and the second item ("enter a dormant state in times of drought") in the series of things mosses can do.

Choice A is incorrect because a semicolon can't be used in this way to separate items in a simple series such as this. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with "And enter." Choice D is incorrect because it fails to use appropriate punctuation to separate the first and second items in the series.

### ID: 7b950fc2 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. It appropriately uses a period to mark the end of one independent clause ("In 2000...settings") and the start of another ("She founded... professionals").

Choice A is incorrect. This choice results in a run-on sentence error. Both the clause before the blank ("In 2000...settings") and the clause after the blank ("she...professionals") are independent clauses, so they need to be separated by punctuation. Choice B is incorrect. This choice results in a comma splice error. It incorrectly joins two independent clauses with just a comma. Linking two independent clauses with a comma also requires the use of a coordination (like for, and, nor, but, or, yet, or so). Choice C is incorrect. This choice results in a run-on sentence, an error caused when two independent clauses are joined without punctuation or appropriate conjunctions. Since both the clause before the blank ("In 2000..settings") and the clause after the blank ("she...professionals") are independent, a comma would be required in addition to the coordinating conjunction "and."

### ID: 1f39ab8b Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The clause before the colon tells us that the novel "asks a question" so the clause after the colon should be in the conventional form of a question: with the verb before the subject, and a question mark at the end.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. classroom.
- B. classroom;
- C. classroom,
- D. classroom

### ID: 9f0ac61d Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of punctuation within a sentence. This choice correctly uses a comma to mark the boundary between the introductory participial phrase ("Hoping...classroom") and the main clause ("Huerta...farmworkers").

Choice A is incorrect because it results in a rhetorically unacceptable sentence fragment beginning with "hoping" Choice B is incorrect because a semicolon can't be used in this way to mark the boundary between the participial phrase ("Hoping... classroom") and the main clause ("Huerta...farmworkers"). Choice D is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the participial phrase ("Hoping...classroom") and the main clause ("Huerta...farmworkers").

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. pieces:
- B. pieces,
- C. pieces
- D. pieces-

### ID: 6997261f Answer

#### Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is punctuation use between a noun and a prepositional phrase. No punctuation is needed between the noun "pieces" and the prepositional phrase "of pottery." The prepositional phrase provides essential information about what kind of pieces were found, so it shouldn't be separated from the rest of the noun phrase ("some of the oldest pieces") with punctuation.

Choice A is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the noun phrase "some of the oldest pieces" and the prepositional phrase "of pottery." Choice B is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the noun phrase "some of the oldest pieces" and the prepositional phrase "of pottery." Choice D is incorrect because no punctuation is needed between the noun phrase "some of the oldest pieces" and the prepositional phrase "of pottery."

- A. Soto would see in her neighborhood?
- B. Soto would see in her neighborhood.
- C. would Soto see in her neighborhood.
- D. would Soto see in her neighborhood?

## ID: 02871a0d Answer

#### Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is end-of-sentence punctuation. This choice correctly uses a period to punctuate a declarative sentence ("For example...neighborhood").

Choice A is incorrect. It's unconventional to use a question mark in this way to punctuate a declarative sentence. Choice C is incorrect. The structure requires a declarative clause at the end of the sentence that states where speels, not an incomplete interrogative clause that asks a direct question, such as "would Soto see in her neighborhood." Choice D is incorrect. The structure requires a period and a declarative clause at the end of the sentence that states where Soto saw the steel panels, not an incomplete interrogative clause asking a direct question, such as "would Soto see in her neighborhood?"

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. libraries train
- B. libraries: train
- C. libraries—train
- D. libraries, train

## ID: a7fdf862 Answer

#### Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the punctuation of items in a simple series. The comma after "libraries" is used conventionally to separate the first and second items ("libraries" and "train stations") in the series.

Choice A is incorrect because it fails to separate the first two items ("libraries" and "train stations") in the series. Choice B is incorrect because a colon can't be used in this way to separate items in a simple series.

Many Samoans enjoy a sport called kilkiti. This bat-and-ball qame was derived from _____ kilkiti differs from cricket in a few key ways.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. cricket but:
- B. cricket but,
- C. cricket, but
- D. cricket, but,

### ID: 8b002b08 Answer

#### Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice correctly uses a comma before the coordination "but" to join the first main clause ("This bat-and-ball game was derived from cricket") and the second main clause ("kilikiti differs from cricket in a few key ways").

Choice A is incorrect. When coordinating two main clauses such as these, it's not conventional to use a colon in this way after the coordinating conjunction. Choice B is incorrect. When coordinating two main clauses such as these, it's not conventional to use a comma in this way after the coordinating conjunction. Choice D is incorrect. When coordinating two main clauses such as these, it's not conventional to use a comma in this way after the coordination.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. time but

B. time, but

C. time,

D. time

## ID: 155239cf Answer

Correct Answer: B

## Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the coordination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice correctly uses a comma and the coordination "but" to join the first main clause ("Scientists...time") and the second main clause ("the Lund...otherwise").

Choice A is incorrect because when coordinating two longer main clauses such as these, it's conventional to use a comma before the coordinating conjunction. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can't be used in this way to join two main clauses. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.

- A. where sound is made?
- B. where is sound made.
- C. where sound is made.
- D. where is sound made?

### ID: 4b0c7b62 Answer

#### Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is end-of-sentence punctuation. This choice correctly uses a period to punctuate a declarative sentence ("the reed of a wind instrument is the mouthpiece") that ends with a prepositional phrase ("where sound is made").

Choice A is incorrect. It's unconventional to use a question mark to punctuate a declarative sentence. Choice B is incorrect. The structure requires that the sentence continue as a declarative clause, not end with an interrogative clause. Choice D is incorrect. The structure requires that the sentence continue as a declarative clause and end with an interrogative clause and a question mark.
