Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. they're

B. their

C. its

D. it's

## ID: 3bceeb93 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The singular possessive pronoun "its" agrees with the singular antecedent "the animal" and indicates that the "young" belong to it.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a pronoun-antecedent agreement error. "They're" is a contraction of "they are," a plural pronoun and verb, but the antecedent "the animal" is singular. Also, we don't need the extra verb "are" — we already have a main verb in this clause, so adding "are" would be confusing and ungrammatical. Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a pronoun-antecedent agreement error. "Their" is a plural pronoun, but the subject of the sentence is "the animal," a sinqular noun. Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a confusing and ungrammatical sentence. "It's" is a contraction for "it is." We already have the verb "nurses" in this clause, so we shouldn't add the verb "is."

- C. these crusts reduce global dust emissions by an estimated 60 percent each year, according to a recent study.
- D. a recent study has estimated that these crusts reduce global dust emissions by 60 percent each year.

## ID: dab8b8ee Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The modifier "fortifying soil in arid ecosystems against erosion" is "biocrusts." Subject-modifier placement requires a modifier and its subject to be next to each other, so "biocrusts" or some variant meaning "biocrusts" (in this case, "these crusts") must begin the missing clause.

Choice A is incorrect. Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The subject of the modifier "fortifying soil in arid ecosystems against erosion" is "biocrusts," not "a recent study's estimate." Choice B is incorrect. Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The modifier "fortifying soil in arid ecosystems against erosion" is "biocrusts," not "an estimated 60 percent reduction." Choice D is incorrect. Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The modifier "fortifying soil in arid ecosystems against erosion" is "biocrusts," not "a recent study."

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. focuses

B. focus

C. are focused

D. were focused

ID: Ofe5ce68 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-verb agreement. The singular verb "focuses" agrees in number with the singular subject "each one of these plays," which refers to each play individually.

Choice B is incorrect because the plural verb "focus" doesn't agree in number with the singular subject "each one of these plays." Choice C is incorrect because the plural verb "are focused" doesn't agree in number with the singular subject "each one of these plays." Choice D is incorrect because the plural verb "were focused" doesn't agree in number with the singular subject "each one of these plays."

C. Chraïbi wrote a debut novel that, published two years before Morocco gained its independence,

D. published two years before Morocco gained its independence, Chraïbi wrote a debut novel that

#### ID: 5b8f9cf2 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. Subject-modifier placement requires a modifier and its subject to be next to each other. The subject of the modifier "a coming-of-age story...colonialism" is Chraïbi's novel The Simple Past, so the subject "Chraïbi's debut novel" fits perfectly after this introductory modifying phrase.

Choice A is incorrect. Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The introductory modifier "a coming-of-age story...colonialism" is describing Chraibi's novel, not Morocco. However, this choice places Morocco directly next to that modifier. Choice C is incorrect. Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The introductory modifier "a coming-of-age story...colonialism" all describes Chraïbi himself. However, this choice places Chraibi directly next to that modifier. Choice D is incorrect. Modifiers and their subjects must go next to each other. The modifier "a coming-of-age story..." is describing Chraibi's novel, so that needs to be the subject immediately after the modifier. This choice adds another modifier that describes Chraibi's novel, but then puts "Chraibi" himself—not the novel—right after that modifier, which doesn't make sense. Chraïbi wasn't "published two years before" Moroccan independence, his novel The Simple Past was.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. to rain

B. raining

C. having rained

D. rain

#### ID: de3dd17d Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. "That...[rain] back onto Mars's surface" is a relative clause the "bits of molten rock." Forming the clause requires a conjugated, finite verb, and this is the only choice that provides that.

Choice A is incorrect. "To rain" is an infinitive and can't serve as the main verb of a clause. A conjugated verb is needed here to form the main verb of the relative clause "that...[rain] back onto Mars's surface," which describes the "bits of molten rock." Choice B is incorrect. "Raining" is a present participle and, on its own, can't serve as the main verb of a clause. A conjugated verb is needed here to form the main verb of the relative clause "that...[rain] back onto Mars's surface," which describes the "bits of molten rock." Choice C is incorrect. "Having rained" is a perfect participle and can't serve as the main verb of a clause. A conjugated verb is needed here to form the main verb of the relative clause "that...[rain] back onto Mars's surface," which describes the "bits of molten rock."

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. looked
- B. looks
- C. is looking

#### ID: 61160f0a Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verb forms within a sentence. The nonfinite present participle verb "looking" is correctly used to form a subordinate clause that describes the intent behind how L'Engle begins her novel.

Choice A is incorrect because the finite past tense verb "looked" can't be used in this way to form a subordinate clause. Choice B is incorrect because the finite present tense verb "looks" can't be used in this way to form a subordinate clause. Choice C is incorrect because the finite present progressive tense verb "is looking" can't be used in this way to form a subordinate clause.

A second-generation Japanese American, Wataru Misaka _________________________ in Won two amateur national basketball championships at the University of Utah when he joined the New York Knicks for the 1947-48 season, becoming the first non-white basketball player in the US's top professional league.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. already served
- B. was already serving
- C. already serves
- D. had already served

#### ID: d46ac7e7 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. Misaka served in World War II before he joined the New York Knicks in 1947. To show that a past occurrence took place before another past occurrence, we need to use "had" + the past tense form of the verb. This is called the past perfect tense.

Choice A is incorrect. Misaka served in World War II before he joined the Knicks. Both events are in the past, but his service in World War II happened earlier, so we need a verb that his service (and the two national championships) had ended by the time he joined the Knicks. Choice B is incorrect. "Was already serving" forms the continuous past tense, which we use when we're showing a past action that was ongoing. Misaka served in World War II before he joined the Knicks. Both events are in the past, but they're not happening at the same time, so we shouldn't use the continuous past tense here. Choice C is incorrect. Misaka served in World War II in the past, so we shouldn't use the present tense "serves."

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. Union would finally acknowledge
- B. Union to finally acknowledge
- C. Union, having finally acknowledged
- D. Union, finally acknowledging

#### ID: 50801257 Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. It's the only choice that offers a form of the verb "acknowledge" that can go with the subject "International Astronomical Union" to make a complete sentence. This might seem like an odd use of "would," but when speaking from a point of view in the past, we can actually use "would" to express something that happened later. That's the case here: 200 years after Wang Zheny's death, the IAU would finally acknowledge her contributions.

Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a sentence fragment. There's no main verb elsewhere in the sentence, so we need a form of the verb "acknowledge" that can go with the subject "the International Astronomical Union" and serve as that main verb. "To acknowledge" can't do that. Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a sentence fragment. There's no main verb elsewhere in the sentence, so we need a form of the verb "acknowledge" that can go with the subject "the International Astronomical Union" and serve as that main verb. "Having acknowledged" can't do that. Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a sentence fragment. There's no main verb elsewhere in the sentence, so we need a form of the verb "acknowledge" that can go with the subject "the International Astronomical Union" and serve as that main verb. The "-ing" form can't do that.

#### ID: 9df6da04 Answer

#### Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-modifier placement. This choice makes the noun phrase "the researchers" the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phrase "knowing...day" In doing so, this choice clearly establishes that the researchers-and not another noun in the sentence-know that flying insects keep their backs pointed toward sunlight during the day.

Choice B is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The noun phrase "the researchers' theory" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that the researchers' theory knows that flying insects keep their backs pointed toward sunlight during the day. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the noun "moths" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that moths know that flying insects keep their backs pointed toward sunlight during the day. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the noun "moths" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that moths know that flying insects keep their backs pointed toward sunlight during the day.
