In recent years, economists around the world have created new tools that quantify the overall well-being of a country's citizens. Economists in India, for example, use an Ease of Living Index. This tool_ economic potential, sustainability, and citizens' quality of life.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. measures
- B. had measured
- C. would have measured
- D. will have been measuring

## ID: 3580533b Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The previous sentence tells us how economists in India "use" a certain tool, while this sentence describes general facts about that tool. To express general facts (and also to match the simple present tense of "use"), we should use the simple present tense form "measures."

Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses the past perfect tense, but the previous sentence tells us that the tool is currently used to measure things, so the past tense doesn't make sense for this verb. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses the future perfect conditional tense, but the previous sentence tells us that the tool is currently used to measure things, so the future tense doesn't make sense for this verb. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses the future perfect continuous tense, but the previous sentence tells us that the tool is currently used to measure things, so the future tense doesn't make sense for this verb.

Mathematician and meteorologist Edward Lorenz used the metaphor of the "butterfly effect" to explain how seemingly minor events can have major impacts on future weather. According to Lorenz's metaphor, the wind from a butterfly flapping ___________ in Brazil might eventually grow into a storm elsewhere across the globe.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. its wings

B. its wings'

C. it's wing's

D. it's wings'

## ID: b7363ba2 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The conventions being tested are the use of possessive determiners and plural nouns. The singular possessive determiner "its" and the plural noun "wings" correctly indicate that the butterfly has multiple wings.

Choice B is incorrect because the context requires the plural noun "wings," not the plural possessive noun "wings'." Choice C is incorrect because the context requires the singular possessive determiner "its" and the plural noun "wings," not the contraction "it's" and the singular possessive noun "wing's." Choice D is incorrect because the context requires the singular possessive determiner "its" and the plural noun "wings," not the contraction "it's" and the plural possessive noun "wings'."

When such an eclipse is imminent, the Sherpas pack up their telescopes and _____________ ready.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. get

B. had gotten

C. got

- D. were getting
### ID: dbd78791 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verbs to express tense in a sentence. In this choice, the present tense verb "get" is consistent with the other present tense verbs ("are"," and "pack") used to describe the Sherpas and their activities.

Choice B is incorrect. The past perfect verb "had gotten" isn't consistent with the other present tense verbs used to describe the Sherpas and their activities. Choice C is incorrect. The past tense verb "got" isn't consistent with the other present tense verbs used to describe the Sherpas and their activities. Choice D is incorrect. The past progressive verb "were getting" isn't consistent with the other present tense verbs used to describe the Sherpas and their activities.

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-verb agreement. The singular verb "was" agrees in number with the singular subject "Farouk El-Baz."

Obsidian is a kind of volcanic glass formed when lava cools so quickly that the atoms inside it cannot arrange themselves in a crystalline structure.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. had learned
- B. had been learning
- C. will learn
- D. have learned

## ID: 57998dd3 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verbs to express tense in a sentence. In this choice, the future tense verb "will learn," used in conjunction with the phrase "in a later chapter"," correctly indicates that "you" (the reader) are going to learn about obsidian's structure at some point in the future.

Choice A is incorrect because the past perfect verb "had learned" doesn't indicate that the subject is going to learn about obsidian's structure in the future. Choice B is incorrect because the past perfect progressive verb "had been learning" doesn't indicate that the subject is going to learn about obsidian's structure in the future. Choice D is incorrect because the present perfect verb "have learned" doesn't indicate that the subject is going to learn about obsidian's structure in the future.

## ID: db4e3819 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-verb agreement. The singular verb "sweeps" agrees in number with the singular subject "she," which refers to Alice Coltrane.

Choice A is incorrect because the plural verb "sweep" doesn't agree in number with the singular subject "she."

Parker's crucial finding was the first _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. places
- B. placed
- C. place
- D. to place

## ID: 69f031ab Answer

Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The verb "was" is "first," and "to place" is acting as a modifier for "first." What was the finding? It was "the first." The first to do what? The first "to place humans in North America" 10,000 years ago. When a verb serves as a modifier within a noun phrase, it must be nonfinite (i.e., not conjugated to a specific subject). The infinitive form "to place" is the only nonfinite option among the choices that makes sense in context.

Choice A is incorrect. The object for the verb "was" is "first," and "places" is acting as a modifier for "first." What was the thing that Parker's finding did? What was it the first to do? Place humans in North America 10,000 years ago. When a verb acts as a modifier, it must be nonfinite (i.e., not conjugated to a specific subject), but "places" is a finite form of the verb. Choice B is incorrect. The verb "was" is "first," and "placed" is acting to modify "first." What was it that Parker's finding was the first to do? Place humans in North America 10,000 years ago. When a verb acts as a modifier, it must be nonfinite (i.e., not conjugated to a specific subject), but "placed" is a finite form. "Placed" can also be a past participle, but that wouldn't make sense here because the meaning of "the first placed humans" would be unclear. Choice C is incorrect. The object for the verb "was" is "first," and "place" is modifying "first." What was the thing that Parker's finding did? What was it the first to do? Place humans in North America. When a verb acts as a modifier, it must be nonfinite (i.e., not conjugated to a specific subject), but "place" is a finite form of the verb. Additionally, "place" can't serve as a noun here, because it results in an illogical sentence (the "finding" wasn't "the first place").

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. promote
- B. are promoting
- C. promotes
- D. have promoted

## ID: f4fd123c Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The sentence is "The African Games Co-production Market." That's one market, so it's a singular noun, which means it needs a singular verb. "Promotes" is the only singular verb among the choices.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a subject-verb agreement error. The subject "The African Games Coproduction Market" is singular, but the verb "promote" is plural. Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a subject-verb agreement error. The African Games Co-production Market" is singular, but the verb "are promoting" is plural. Choice D is incorrect. This choice creates a subject-verb agreement error. The subject "The African Games Co-production Market" is singular, but the verb "have promoted" is plural.

### ID: b260c65a Answer

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. to have suspended
- B. suspending
- C. to suspend
- D. suspended

#### ID: 7c48a6dd Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The past tense of "suspended" matches the past tense of "applied," which has the same subject ("he") and takes place in the same context: "He applied...and [he] suspended."

Choice A is incorrect. The perfect infinitive "to have suspended" doesn't match the past tense of "applied," and it can't serve as a verb on its own. These are both verbs with the same subject and in the same context, so there's no need to shift tenses. Choice B is incorrect. The present participle "suspending" doesn't match the past tense of "applied," and it can't serve as a verb on its own. These are both verbs with the same subject and in the same context, so there's no need to shift tenses. Choice C is incorrect. The infinitive "to suspend" doesn't match the past tense of "applied," and it can't serve as a verb on its own. These are both verbs with the same subject and in the same context, so there's no need to shift tenses.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. is

B. will be

C. has been

D. was

#### ID: e2759b92 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verbs to express tense in a sentence. In this choice, the past tense verb "was ruled" correctly indicates that Oba Ewuare I ruled the Kingdom of Benin in the distant past (from 1440 to 1473). This past tense verb choice is consistent with the other past tense verb ("was") used to describe the Kingdom of Benin.

Choice A is incorrect because the present tense verb "is ruled" doesn't indicate that Oba Ewuare I ruled the Kingdom of Benin in the distant past. Choice B is incorrect because the future tense verb "will be ruled" doesn't indicate that Oba Ewuare I ruled the Kingdom of Benin in the distant past.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. serving

B. having served

C. served

- D. to serve
ID: 175df826 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verb forms within a sentence. Relative clauses, such as the one beginning with "how" require a finite (tensed) verb, a verb that can function as the main verb of a clause. This choice correctly supplies the clause with the finite past tense verb "served."

Choice A is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonfinite participle "serving" doesn't supply the clause with a finite verb. Choice B is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonfinite participle "having served" doesn't supply the clause with a finite verb. Choice D is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonfinite to-infinitive "to serve" doesn't supply the clause with a finite verb.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. reach
- B. had reached
- C. will reach
- D. are reaching

#### ID: 31362d2d Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verbs to express tense. In this choice, the past perfect verb "had reached" is used correctly to describe a past action that was completed before another action in the past. Specifically, in this hypothetical scenario about the origins of RNA and DNA on Earth, the simple sugars had to have reached Earth before they could react with other molecules on the planet.

Choice A is incorrect because the present tense verb "reach" doesn't indicate that the simple sugars reached Earth before reacting with other molecules on the planet. Choice C is incorrect because the future tense verb "will reach" doesn't indicate that the simple sugars reacting with other molecules on the planet. Choice D is incorrect because the present progressive verb "are reaching" doesn't indicate that the simple sugars reached Earth before reacting with other molecules on the planet.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. photographer's early photo's
- B. photographers early photo's
- C. photographer's early photos
- D. photographers early photos

#### ID: 1d971f75 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. There's only one photographer (Adams), and the photos are his, so the singular possessive "photographer's" is correct. There's more than one photo, and nothing belongs to the photos, so the simple plural "photos" is correct.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses the singular possessive "photo's," which isn't correct. There's more than one photo, and they don't possess anything, so the noun should be the simple plural "photos." Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses the simple plural "photographers" and the singular possessive "photo's," which aren't correct. There's only one photographer (Adams) and there's more than one photo. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses the simple plural "photographers," which isn't correct. There's only one photographer (Adams).

Searching for food and warmer habitats, they _____________________________________________________________________________________________ as far north as Canada all the way down to Mexico—on this annual migration.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. flew

B. were flying

C. had flown

D. fly

ID: f40ca576 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verbs to express tense. In this choice, the present tense verb "fly" is consistent with the other present tense verb ("journey") used to describe the butterflies' yearly migration. Together, these simple present tense verbs correctly indicate that the migration is a current, yearly occurrence.

Choice A is incorrect. The simple past tense verb "flew" isn't consistent with the other present tense verb used to describe the butterflies' yearly migration. Choice B is incorrect. The past progressive tense verb "were flying" isn't consistent with the other present tense verb used to describe the butterflies' yearly migration. Choice C is incorrect. The past perfect tense verb "had flown" isn't consistent with the other present tense verb used to describe the butterflies' yearly migration.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. has enabled
- B. enable
- C. is enabling

ID: 4c9a2aee Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-verb agreement. The plural verb "enable" agrees in number with the plural subject "sound-based tools."

Choice A is incorrect because the singular verb "has enabled" doesn't agree in number with the plural subject "sound-based tools." Choice C is incorrect because the singular verb "is enabling" doesn't agree in number with the plural subject "sound-based tools." Choice D is incorrect because the singular verb "enables" doesn't agree in number with the plural subject "sound-based tools."

If you try on one of artist Nick Cave's signature Soundsuits, you can expect to swish, rustle, or clang every time you move. Cave makes his suits out of found objects, everything from ceramic birds to broken record players. He carefully considers the sound an object makes before using _______________ in a suit.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. this

B. that

C. these

D. it

ID: 42cc9236 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested here is pronoun-antecedent agreement. The singular pronoun "it" agrees in number with the singular antecedent "object."

Choice A is incorrect. The singular pronoun "this" is used to refer to a specific thing, but here there is no specific object being referred to. Instead, the sentence is referring back to a hypothetical object that Cave might use in a Soundsuit. Choice B is incorrect. The singular pronoun "that" is used to refer to a specific thing, but here there is no specific object being referred to. Instead, the sentence is referring back to a hypothetical object that Cave might use in a Soundsuit. Choice C is incorrect because the plural pronoun "these" doesn't agree in number with the singular antecedent "object."

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. having included
- B. including
- C. to include
- D. includes

### ID: ec08463d Answer

Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. This verb needs to function as the main verb in the subject "one species" so it needs to be conjugated. This choice qives us the singular present tense "includes," which is the only conjugated form of the verb among the choices.

Choice A is incorrect. This doesn't complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. This verb needs to function as the main verb in the sentence, with the subject "one species" so it needs to be conjugated. "Having included" is a participle form of the verb: it's not conjugated and doesn't function like a normal verb. Choice B is incorrect. This doesn't complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. This verb needs to function as the main verb in the sentence, with the subject "one species," so it needs to be conjugated. "Including" is the gerund form of the verb: it's not conjugated and doesn't function like a normal verb. Choice C is incorrect. This doesn't complete the text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English. This verb needs to function as the main verb in the sentence, with the subject "one species," so it needs to be conjugated. "To include" is the infinitive form of the verb: it's not conjuqated.

In 1990, California native and researcher Ellen Ochoa left her position as chief of the Intelligent Systems Technology Branch at a NASA research center _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. to join
- B. is joining
- C. joined
- D. joins

## ID: 4a90a978 Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of nonfinite verb forms in a sentence. The nonfinite to-infinitive verb "to join" is correctly used to form a subordinate clause that expresses why Ochoa left her position (to join the training program).

Choice B is incorrect because the finite verb "is joining" can't be used in this way to indicate Ochoa's action of joining the training program. A conjunction such as "and" would be needed to coordinate "is joining" with the previous finite verb, "left." Choice C is incorrect because the finite verb "joined" can't be used in this way to indicate Ochoa's action of joining the training program. A conjunction such as "and" would be needed to coordinate "joined" with the previous finite verb, "left." Choice D is incorrect because the finite verb "joins" can't be used in this way to indicate Ochoa's action of joining the training program.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. explain

## ID: 59e41600 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verb forms within a sentence. The main clause of a sentence requires a finite (tensed) verb, and this choice supplies the finite present tense verb "explain" to indicate what the scientists do.

Choice B is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonfinite participle "having explained" doesn't supply the main clause with a finite verb. Choice C is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonfinite participle "explaining" doesn't supply the main clause with a finite verb.

In 1881, French chemist Camille Faure redesigned the rechargeable lead-acid battery. Faure's design greatly increased the amount of electricity that the original battery, which the French physicist Gaston Planté _ fifteen years earlier, could hold.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. is inventing
- B. will invent
- C. invents
- D. had invented

## ID: 588887b9 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. Faure redesigned the battery in 1881, and the original battery was invented "fifteen years earlier." Notice that this is the only choice in the past tense. To indicate that a past occurrence took place before another past occurrence, we need to use "had" + the past tense form of the verb. This is called the "past perfect" tense.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice creates a tense error. Planté invented the original battery in the past, so we shouldn't use the present tense "is inventing." Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a tense error. Planté invented the original battery in the past, so we shouldn't use the future tense "will invent." Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a tense error. Planté invented the original battery in the past, so we shouldn't use the present tense "invents."

The alga species Chlorella vulgaris is very efficient at making oxygen. For this reason, scientists are currently exploring ways to use this species in space. C. vulgaris might be used, for example, to build future biological air exchange systems that ________ oxygen for astronauts.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. are producing
- B. produced
- C. produce
- D. have produced

### ID: 96e5da01 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verbs to express tense. Simple present tense verbs can be used to describe actions that tend to occur, including in a hypothetical or future scenario. In this case, the simple present tense verb "produce" indicates what the air exchange systems might be able to do in the future (produce oxygen for astronauts).

Choice A is incorrect. The present progressive tense verb "are producing" suggests that the oxygen is currently being produced, not that it might be produced in the future. Choice B is incorrect because the past tense verb "produced" suggests that the oxygen was produced in the past, not that it might be produced in the future. Choice D is incorrect because the present perfect tense verb "have produced" suggests that the oxygen has been produced from a point in the past up to the present, not that it might be produced in the future.

A. it was

### ID: 12bd5b75 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is pronoun-antecedent agreement. The singular pronoun "it" agrees in number with the singular antecedent "the Salt Lake Temple."

Choice B is incorrect because the singular pronoun "one" is ambiguous in this context; the resulting sentence leaves unclear whether there is only one Salt Lake temple or multiple.

## ID: bd11fe93 Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verb forms within a sentence.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. ensuring
- B. this will ensure
- C. ensures
- D. it ensures

## ID: 94de423a Answer

#### Correct Answer: A

### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verb forms within a sentence. The nonfinite present participle "ensuring" is correctly used to form a supplementary element that main clause "Okie-Tex takes place in an area with low light pollution," describing the viewing conditions of the star party.

Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. The pronoun "this" and the finite future" would add an additional main clause to this sentence, and the comma after "pollution" can't be used in this way to join two main clauses. Choice C is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The finite present tense verb "ensures" can't be used in this way to form a supplement to modify the main clause. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. The pronoun "it" and the finite present tense verb "ensures" would add an additional main clause to this sentence, and the comma after "pollution" can't be used in this way to join two main clauses.

ID: 5ad2a12c Answer

ID: f339ee39 Answer

### Correct Answer: A

### Rationale

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. is being

B. was

C. is

D. will be

ID: a94b7fd6 Answer

### Correct Answer: B

### Rationale

Choice B is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verbs to express tense in a sentence. In this choice, the past tense verb "was," used in conjunction with the prepositional phrase "from outside the United States" correctly indicates that in the 1860s nearly 30% of the population in Los Angeles wasn't from the US.

Choice A is incorrect because the present progressive tense verb "is being" doesn't indicate that the claim about Los Angeles's population refers to the population back in the 1860s. Choice C is incorrect because the present tense verb "is" doesn't indicate that the claim about Los Angeles's population refers to the population back in the 1860s. Choice D is incorrect because the future tense verb "will be" doesn't indicate that the claim about Los Angeles's population refers to the population back in the 1860s.

## ID: f0f9bf8f Answer

### Correct Answer: D

### Rationale

Choice D is the best answer. The convention being tested is pronoun-antecedent agreement. The singular pronoun "he" agrees in number with the singular antecedent "Félix González-Torres" and it clearly indicates that González-Torres created the additional installations.

Choice A is incorrect because the plural noun phrase "they all" doesn't agree in number with the singular antecedent "Félix González-Torres," and it doesn't clearly indicate that he (González-Torres) created the additional installations.

According to linguist Martin Joos, speakers of the English language ________ five main registers-frozen, formal, consultative, casual, and intimate—which they rotate between depending on the situation.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

- A. use
- B. is using
- C. uses
- D. has used

## ID: 0aebdf5f Answer

### Correct Answer: A

### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is subject-verb agreement. The plural verb "use" agrees in number with the plural subject "speakers."

Choice B is incorrect because the singular verb "is using" doesn't agree in number with the plural subject "speakers." Choice C is incorrect because the singular verb "uses" doesn't agree in number with the plural subject "speakers." Choice D is incorrect because the sinqular verb "has used" doesn't agree in number with the plural subject "speakers."

According to the traditional RYB (red-yellow-blue) color model, yellow is a complementary color to purple. However, yellow considered complementary to blue in modern color theory.

Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?

A. is

B. having been

C. to be

D. being

ID: e6f2dba6 Answer

### Correct Answer: A

### Rationale

Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the use of verb forms within a sentence. A main clause requires a finite (tensed) verb to perform the action of the subject (in this case, "yellow"), and this choice supplies the present tense verb "is considered" to indicate that yellow is considered a complementary color to blue in modern color theory.

Choice B is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonfinite participle "having been considered" doesn't supply the main clause with a finite verb. Choice C is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonfinite to-infinitive "to be considered" doesn't supply the main clause with a finite verb. Choice D is incorrect because it results in an ungrammatical sentence. The nonfinite "being considered" doesn't supply the main clause with a finite verb.
