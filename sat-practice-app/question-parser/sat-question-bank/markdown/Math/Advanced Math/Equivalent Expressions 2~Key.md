4a2 +20ab +25b2

2.1

Which of the following is a factor of the polynomial above?

A. a + b

B. 2a+5b

C. 4a+5b

D. 4a+25b

## ID: dd4ab4c4 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. The first and last terms of the polynomial are both squares such that 4 a2 = (2a)2 and 25b2 = (5b)2. The second term is twice the product of the square root of the first and last terms: 20ab = 2(2a)(5b). Therefore, the polynomial is the square of a binomial such that 4a2 +20ab +25b2 = (2a+5b)2, and (2a+5b) is a factor.

Choice A is incorrect and may be the result of incorrectly factoring the polynomial. Choice C is incorrect and may be the result of dividing the second and third terms of the polynomial by their greatest common factor. Choice D is incorrect and may be the result of not factoring the coefficients.

If p = 3x + 4 and v = x + 5, which of the following is

equivalent to pv -2p + v ?

A. 3x2 +12x +7 B. 3x2 +14x +17 c. 3x2 +19x +20 D. 3x2 +26x +33

#### ID: b8caaf84 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. It's given that p = 3x + 4 and v = x + 5. Substituting the values for p and v into the expression pv -2p + v yields (3x +4)(x +5) -2(3x +4) + x +5. Multiplying the terms (3x +4)(x +5) yields 3x2 + 4x + 15x + 20. Using the distributive property to rewrite −2(3x +4) yields −6x −8. Therefore, the entire expression can be represented as 3x2 +4x +15x +20 -6x -8 +x +5 Combining like terms yields 3x2 +14x +17

Choice A is incorrect and may result from subtracting, instead of adding, the term x +5. Choice C is incorrect. This is the result of multiplying the terms (3x +4)(x +5). Choice D is incorrect and may result from distributing 2, instead of — 2, to the term 3x + 4.

A. (x2+1)(x2-6) B. (x2+2)(x2-3) c. (x2+3)(x2-2) D. (x2+6)(x2-1)

### ID: ad2ec615 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. The term x 1 can be factored as (x0)(x2). Factoring –6 as (2)( –3) yields values that add to −1, the coefficient of x 2 in the expression.

Choices A, C, and D are incorrect and may result from finding factors of –6 that don't add to the coefficient of x = in the original expression.

Which of the following is equivalent to the expression above?

A. 4x2 +21x +33 B. 4x2 +21x +29 c. 4x2 + x + 29 D. 4x2 + x + 33

#### ID: 42c71eb5 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. The given expression can be rewritten as (2x + 5)2 + ( - 1 )(x - 2) + 2(x + 3). Applying the distributive property, the expression (-1)(x-2)+2(x+3)can be rewritten as -1(x)+(-1)(-2)+2(x)+2(3) , or -x +2 +2x +6. Adding like terms yields x + 8. Substituting x + 8 for ( -1)(x -2) + 2(x +3) in the given expression yields (2x + 5) + x + 8. By the rules of exponents, the expression (2x + 5) is equivalent to (2x +5)(2x +5). Applying the distributive property, this expression can be rewritten as 2x(2x) + 2x(5) + 5(2x) + 5(5), or 4x2 + 10x + 25. Adding like terms gives 4x2 + 20x + 25. Substituting 4x2 +20x +25 for (2x +5)2 in the rewritten expression yields 4x2 + 20x +25 + x +8, and adding like terms vields 4x2 +21x +33

Choices B, C, and D are incorrect. Choices C and D may result from rewriting the expression (2x + 5) = as 4x2 +25, instead of as 4x2 +20x +25. Choices B and C may result from rewriting the expression -(x -2) as -x-2, instead of -x +2

Which of the following expressions is equivalent to x2 – 5 ?

A. (x+√5)2 b. (x-√5)2 c. (x+√5)(x-√5) D. (x +5)(x - 1)

### ID: a05bd3a4 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is correct. The expression can be written as a difference of squares x = y , which can be factored as (x + y)(x - y). Here, y = = 5, so y = √ 5, and the expression therefore factors as (x +√ 5)(x -√ 5)

Choices A and B are incorrect and may result from misunderstanding how to factor a difference of squares. Choice D is incorrect; (x + 5)(x – 1) can be rewritten as x = + 4x – 5, which is not equivalent to the original expression.

- Which of the following is an equivalent form of (1.5x-2.4)2-(5.2x2-6.4) ?
- A. 2.2x2 + 1.6
- B. 2.2x2 + 11.2
- c. 2.95x2 7.2x + 12.16
- D. 2.95x2 7.2x + 0.64

## ID: cc776a04 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is correct. The first expression (1.5x -2.4)2 can be rewritten as (1.5x -2.4)(1.5x -2.4)(1.5x -2.4). Applying the distributive property to this product yields (2.25x2 – 3.6x – 3.6x – 5.76) – (5.2x2 – 6.4). This difference can be rewritten as (2.25x2 - 3.6x +5.76) +(-1)(5.2x2-6.4). Distributing the factor of =1 through the second expression yields 2.25x2-3.6x-3.6x+5.76-5.2x2+6.4 . Regrouping like terms, the expression becomes (2.25x2-5.2x2)+(-3.6x-3.6x)+(5.76+6.4) .Combining like terms yields -2.95x2 -7.2x +12.16

Choices A, B, and D are incorrect and likely result from errors made when applying the distributive property or combining the resulting like terms.

- c. 8d3 48d2 3d + 18
- D. 8d3 51d2 + 48

## ID: 5b6af6b1 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

### ID: a255ae72 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. It's given that x = a + b and y = a + c. Using the distributive property, the expression (x2 – y2)2 can be rewritten as (x22 – 2x2y2 + (y2)2 . Substituting a + b and a + c for x 3 and y2, respectively, in this expression yields (a+b)2-2((a+b)(a+c))+(a+c)2. Expanding this expression yields (a2 +2ab +b2) =(2a2 +2bc +2ac +2ab) +(a2 +2ac +c2). Combining like terms, this expression can be rewritten as b2-2bc+c2

Choices A, C, and D are incorrect and may result from an error in using the distributive property, substituting, or combining like terms.

Which of the following is equivalent to the expression above?

A. (x + 3)2 + 5 B. (x + 3)2 – 5 c. (x – 3)2 + 5 D. (x – 3)2

### ID: a1bf1c4e Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. The given quadratic expression is in standard form, and each answer choice is in vertex form. Completing the square converts the expression from standard form to vertex form. The first step is to rewrite the expression as follows: x2-+6x+4=x2+6x+9+4-9. The first three terms of the revised expression can be rewritten as a perfect square as follows: x2 +6x +9 +4 −9 = (x +3) +4 −9, Combining the constant terms gives (x +3)2 – 5

Choice A is incorrect. Squaring the binomial and simplifying the expression in choice A gives x 2 + 6x + 9 + 5 Combining like terms gives x2 +6x +14, not x2 +6x +4. Choice C is incorrect. Squaring the binomial and simplifying the expression in choice C gives x - 6x +9 +5. Combining like terms gives x - 6x + 14, not x 2 + 6x + 4. Choice D is incorrect. Squaring the binomial and simplifying the expression in choice D gives x2-6x+9-5. Combining like terms gives x2-6x+4, not x2+6x+4

The sum of –2x2 + x + 31 and 3x2 + 7x – 8 can be written in the form ax2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants. What is the value of a+b+c ?

### ID: f237ccfc Answer

Rationale

The correct answer is 32. The sum of the given expressions is (-2x2 + x + 31) + (3x2 + 7x -8). Combining like terms yields x2 +8x +23. Based on the form of the given equation, a = 1, b = 8, and c = 23. Therefore, a+b+c=32

Alternate approach: Because α+b+c is the value of αχ+γ bx +C when x = 1, it is possible to first make that substitution into each polynomial before adding them. When x = 1, the first polynomial is equal to —2 + 1 + 31 = 30 and the second polynomial is equal to 3 + 7 −8 = 2. The sum of 30 and 2 is 32.

c. 12x4+14x3

D. 7x4+9x3

### ID: c3a72da5 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. Adding the two expressions yields 3x4 + 2x3 + 4x4 + 7x3. Because the pair of terms 3x4 and 4x and the pair of terms 2x3 and 7x3 each contain the same variable raised to the same power, they are like terms and can be combined as 7x and 9x3, respectively. The sum of the given expressions therefore simplifies to 7x4 +9x3

Choice A is incorrect and may result from adding the coefficients and the exponents in the given expressions. Choice B is incorrect and may result from adding the exponents as well as the coefficients of the like terms in the given expressions. Choice C is incorrect and may result from multiplying, rather than adding, the coefficients of the like terms in the given expressions.

2.15

If the given expression is rewritten in the form (2x - 3)(x + k), where k is a constant, what is the value of k ?

### ID: 16de54c7 Answer

Rationale

The correct answer is 4. It's given that 2x2 +5x − 12 can be rewritten as (2x −3)(x + k); it follows that (2x -3)(x + k) = 2x2 + 5x - 12. Expanding the left-hand side of this equation yields 2x2 +2kx - 3x - 3k = 2x2 + 5x - 12. Subtracting 2x2 from both sides of this equation yields 2kx – 3x – 3x – 5x – 12. Using properties of equality, 2kx – 3x = 5x and – 3k = – 12. Either equation can be solved for k. Dividing both sides of -3k = - 12 by - 3 yields k = 4. The equation 2kx - 3x = 5x can be rewritten as x(2k – 3) = 5x. It follows that 2k – 3 = 5. Solving this equation for k also yields k = 4. Therefore, the value of k is 4.

A. - 10x3-3x2 + x + 3 B. -2x3-7x2+x+3 c. -2x3-3x2+x+3 D. 10x3-7x2-x+3

#### ID: 8838a672 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. Using the distributive property, the given expression can be rewritten as 4x3 -5x2 +3 -6x3 -2x2 +x. Combining like terms, this expression can be rewritten as (4-6)x3 + (-5-2)x2 +x +3, which is equivalent to -2x3 -7x2 +x +3

Choices A, C, and D are incorrect and may result from an error when applying the distributive property or an error when combining like terms.

Which of the following is equivalent to the expression above?

A. x-23y в. 2x2-ху-3у2 c. 2x2+24xy+36y2

D. 2x2-49xy+69y2

### ID: c602140f Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correçt. Expanding all terms yields (x – 11y)(2x – 3y) – 12y(一2x – 39), which is equivalent to 2x1
22xy – 3xy + 33y – 24xy – 36y – Combining like terms gives 2x

Choice A is incorrect and may be the result of using the sums of the existing x and y terms as the coefficients of the x and y terms in the new expressions. Choice C is incorrect and may be the result of incorrectly combining like terms. Choice D is incorrect and may be the result of using the incorrect sign in front of the 12y term.
