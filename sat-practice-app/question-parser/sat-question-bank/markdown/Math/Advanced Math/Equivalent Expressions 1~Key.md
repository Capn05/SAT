(x + 5) + (2x - 3)

1.1

Which of the following is equivalent to the given expression?

A. 3x - 2

B. 3x +2

C. 3x -8

D. 3x +8

### ID: e312081b Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. Using the associative and commutative properties of addition, the given expression (x+5)+(2x -3) can be rewritten as (x+2x)+(5-3). Adding these like terms results in 3x +2.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from adding (x −5) +(2x + 3). Choice C is incorrect and may result from adding (x = 5) +(2x = 3). Choice D is incorrect and may result from adding (x +5) + (2x +3)

Which of the following is equivalent to 3(x +5) -6 ?

A. 3x - 3

B. 3x - 1

C. 3x +9

D. 15x - 6

#### ID: 1d3fee25 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is correct. Using the distributive property to multiply 3 and (x+5) gives 3x +15—6, which can be rewritten as 3x +9.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from rewriting the given expression as 3(x +5 - 6). Choice B is incorrect and may result from incorrectly rewriting the expression as (3x +5) — 6. Choice D is incorrect and may result from incorrectly rewriting the expression as 3(5x) - 6.

- Which expression is equivalent to (2x2-4)-(-3x2 +2x-7) ?
- A. 5x2-2x+3 B. 5x2+2x-3
- c. -x2-2x-11
- D. x2 + 2x 11

## ID: 60fdb4d4 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. The given expression (2x² –4) – (−3x² +2x – 7) can be rewritten as
ay 3 – 4 × 3x3 – 3x + 7 2x2-4+3x2-2x+7. Combining like terms yields 5x2-2x+3

Choices B, C, and D are incorrect and may be the result of errors when applying the distributive property.

The expression 2x2 + ax is equivalent to x(2x +7) for some

constant a. What is the value of a ?

A. 2

B. 3

C. 4

D. 7

### ID: 49efde89 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. It's given that 2x2 + ax is equivalent to x(2x +7) for some constant a. Distributing the x over each term in the parentheses gives 2x2 +7x, which is in the same form as the first given expression, 2x2 + ax. The coefficient of the second term in 2x2 +7x is 7. Therefore, the value of a is 7.

Choice A is incorrect. If the value of a were 2, then 2x2 +0x would be equivalent to 2x2 +2x, which isn't equivalent to x(2x+7). Choice B is incorrect. If the value of a were 3, then 2x2 + ax would be equivalent to 2x2 +3x, which isn't equivalent to x(2x +7). Choice C is incorrect. If the value of a were 4, then 2x + ax would be equivalent to 2x2 +4x, which isn't equivalent to x(2x +7).

- Which of the following is equivalent to 2(x2-x)+3(x2-x) ?
A. 5x2-5x B. 5x2+5x C. 5x

D. 5x2

### ID: 9ed9f54d Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. Since (x2 –x) is a common term in the original expression, like terms can be added: 2(x2-x) +3(x2-x) =5(x2-x). Distributing the constant term 5 yields 5x2-5x

Choice B is incorrect and may result from not distributing the negative signs in the expressions within the parentheses. Choice C is incorrect and may result from not distributing the negative signs in the expressions within the parentheses and from incorrectly eliminating the X -term. Choice D is incorrect and may result from incorrectly eliminating the x-term.

Which of the following is equivalent to 2x3 +4?

A. 4(x3 +4)

B. 4(x3+2)

c. 2(x3 +4)

D. 2(x3+2)

### ID: 294db8ec Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. The expression 2x3 +4 has two terms, 2x3 and 4. The greatest common factor of these two terms is 2. Factoring 2 from each of these terms yields 2(x3) +2(2), or 2(x3 +2)

Choices A and B are incorrect because 4 is not a factor of the term 2x 3. Choice C is incorrect and may result from factoring 2 from 2x3 but not from 4.

A. 5a3

B. 8a5

c. 2a3 +3

D. 2a3 +6a2

#### ID: 6e06a0a7 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. Expanding the given expression using the distributive property yields 2a2 (a) +2a -(3), Combining like terms yields 2a2(a1)+(2×3)(a2), or 2a2+1+6a2, which is equivalent to 2a3+6a2

Choices A and B are incorrect and may result from incorrectly combining like terms. Choice C is incorrect and may result from distributing 2a2 only to a, and not to 3, in the given expression.

A. X3 +5x B. 3x3 +x c. 2x6-x4-6x2 D. 3x6-x4-6x2

#### ID: df0ef054 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is correct. Using the distributive property to multiply the terms in the parentheses yields (2x³ x³) + (2x³ - - 2x) + (3x - x³) + (3x - - 2x), which is equivalent to 2x - 4x + 3x + - 6x2 . Combining like terms results in 2x6-x4-6x2

Choices A and D are incorrect and may result from conceptual errors when multiplying the terms in the given expression. Choice B is incorrect and may result from adding, instead of multiplying, (2x3 +3x) and (x3 −2x)

- A. d2 + 24
- B. d2 + 11
- C. d2 + 5
- D. d2 11

### ID: 127b2759 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

- A. 2ab 1
- B. 2ab-4
- C. 2ab-5
- D. 2ab-8

## ID: fb96a5b3 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. Applying the distributive property to the given expression yields 2(ab) + 2( − 3) + 2, or 2 ab - 6 + 2. Adding the like terms - 6 and 2 results in the expression 2 ab - 4.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from multiplying ab by 2 without multiplying — 3 by 2 when applying the distributive property. Choices C and D are incorrect and may result from computational or conceptual errors.

Which expression is equivalent to 256w2 - 676?

A. (16w - 26)(16w - 26)

- B. (8w 13)(8w + 13)
- C. (8w 13)(8w 13)
- D. (16w 26)(16w + 26)

## ID: 1e8d7183 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. The given expression follows the difference of two squares pattern, x2 — y , which factors as (x — y)(x + y). Therefore, the expression 256w2 — 676 can be written as (16w)2 — 262, or (16w)(16w) — (26)(26), which factors as (16w — 26)(16w + 26).

Choice A is incorrect. This expression is equivalent to 256w² — 832w + 676.

Choice B is incorrect. This expression is equivalent to 64w2 - 169.

Choice C is incorrect. This expression is equivalent to 64w2 - 208w + 169.

A. r5 + 13r3 + 19 B. 2r3 +13r2 +19 c. r3 +5r2 +7r + 12 D. 13 +6r2 +8r + 19

### ID: 974d33dc Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. Grouping like terms, the given expressions can be rewritten as r3 +(5/2 + r2) + 12) . This can be rewritten as 13 +6r2 +8r + 19

Choice A is incorrect and may result from adding the two sets of unlike terms, n and o as 5r and 8r, and then adding the respective exponents. Choice B is incorrect and may result from adding the unlike terms n and reas if they were 1 and adding the unlike terms 52 and 8r as if they were 5r and 8r .

- C. 3(4x + 9)
- D. 3(9x + 24)

### ID: d4d513ff Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is correct. Each term in the given expression, 12x + 27, has a common factor of 3. Therefore, the expression can be rewritten as 3(4x) + 3(9), or 3(4x + 9). Thus, the expression 3(4x + 9) is equivalent to the given expression.
