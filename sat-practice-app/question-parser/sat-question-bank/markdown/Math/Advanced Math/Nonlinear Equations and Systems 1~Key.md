6x-9y > 12

1.1

Which of the following inequalities is equivalent to the inequality above?

A. x-y>2

B. 2x - 3y > 4

C. 3x-2y>4

D. 3y-2x > 2

#### ID: 3c95093c Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. Both sides of the given inequality can be divided by 3 to yield 2x – 3y > 4.

Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because they are not equivalent to (do not have the same solution set as) the given inequality. For example, the ordered pair (0, – 1.5) is a solution to the given inequality, but it is not a solution to any of the inequalities in choices A, C, or D.

Which of the following is a solution to the equation 2x2-4 = x2 ?

A. 1

B. 2

C. 3

D. 4

#### ID: 3de7a7d7 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

2 from both sides of the given equation yields x = = 4 = 0. Adding 4 to both Choice B is correct. Subtracting x sides of the equation gives x = 4. Taking the square root of both sides of the equation gives x = 2 or x = −2. Therefore, x = 2 is one solution to the original equation.

Alternative approach: Subtracting x from both sides of the given equation yields x = 4 = 0. Factoring this equation gives x – 4 = (x + 2)(x – 2) = 0, such that x = 2 or x = −2. Therefore, x = 2 is one solution to the original equation.

Choices A, C, and D are incorrect and may be the result of computation errors.

1.5

If (x y) is a solution to the system of equations above, which of the following is a possible value of x?

A. O

B. 1

- C. 2
D. 3

#### ID: 568aaf27 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. Substituting X from the second equation for y in the first equation yields X + x = 12 Subtracting 12 from both sides of this equation and rewriting the equation results in X2 +x −12 = 0. Factoring the left-hand side of this equation yields (x −3)(x +4) = 0. Using the zero product property to solve for x, it follows that x - 3 = 0 and x + 4 = 0. Solving each equation for x yields x = 3 and x = = 4, respectively. Thus, two possible values of x are 3 and —4. Of the choices given, 3 is the only possible value of x.

Choices A, B, and C are incorrect. Substituting 0 for x in the first equation gives 0 + y = 12, or y = 12; then, substituting 12 for y and 0 for x in the second equation gives 12 = 02, or 12 = 0, which is false. Similarly, substituting 1 or 2 for x in the first equation yields y = 11 or y = 10, respectively; then, substituting 11 or 10 for y in the second equation yields a false statement.

The power P produced by a machine is represented by the equation above, where W is the work performed during an amount of time t. Which of the following correctly expresses W in terms of P and t ?

$$\mathsf{A. } \mathsf{M} = \mathsf{P}t$$

$$\mathcal{W} = \frac{P}{t}$$

$$\text{c. } \mathcal{W} = \frac{t}{P}$$

D.W=P+t

#### ID: b76a2815 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. Multiplying both sides of the equation by t yields expresses W in terms of P and t. This is equivalent to W = Pt.

Choices B, C, and D are incorrect. Each of the expressions qiven in these answer choices qives W in terms of P and t but doesn't maintain the given relationship between W, P, and t. These expressions may result from performing different operations with t on each side of the equation. In choice B, W has been multiplied by t, and P has been divided by t. In choice C, W has been multiplied by t, and the quotient of P divided by t has been reciprocated. In choice D, W has been multiplied by t, and P has been added to t. However, in order to maintain the relationship between the variables in the given equation, the same operation must be performed with t on each side of the equation.

$$|x - 2| = 9$$

What is one possible solution to the given equation?

#### ID: c7789423 Answer

Correct Answer: 11, -7

Rationale

The correct answer is 11 or -7. By the definition of absolute value, if |x - 2| = 9, then x - 2 = 9 or x - 2 = - 9. Adding 2 to both sides of the equation x - 2 = 9 yields x = 11. Adding 2 to both sides of the equation x — 2 = - 9 yields x = — 7. Thus, the given equation, |x — 2| = 9, has two possible solutions, 11 and —7. Note that 11 and -7 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer.
