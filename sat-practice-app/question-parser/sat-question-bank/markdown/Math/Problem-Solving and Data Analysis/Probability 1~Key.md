| Red   | 8      |
| Blue  | 10     |
| Green | 22     |
| Total | 40     |

The table shows the number of different colors of marbles in a bag. If a marble is chosen at random from the bag, what is the probability that the marble will be blue?

|-------|
| A. 40 |
| 22    |
| B. 40 |
| c. 18 |
|       |
| 10    |

D. 40

#### ID: 1353b86e Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. If a marble is chosen at random from the bag, the probability of choosing a marble of a certain color is the number of that color divided by the total number of marbles in the bag. Since there are 10 blue marbles in the bag, and there are 40 total marbles in the bag, the probability that the marble 10 chosen will be blue is 40

Choices A, B, and C are incorrect. These represent the marble chosen won't be blue (choice A), will be green (choice B), and won't be green (choice C).

On Tuesday, a local gas station had 135 customers. The table above summarizes whether or not the customers on Tuesday purchased gasoline, a beverage, both, or neither. Based on the data in the table, what is the probability that a gas station customer selected at random on that day did not purchase gasoline?

## ID: d89c1513 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. The total number of gas station customers on Tuesday was 135. The table shows that the number of customers who did not purchase gasoline was 50. Finding the ratio of the number of customers who did not purchase gasoline to the total number of customers gives the probability that a customer selected at 50 random on that day did not purchase gasoline, which is 135 .

Choice A is incorrect and may result from finding the probability that a customer did not purchase a beverage, given that the customer did not purchase gasoline. Choice B is incorrect and may result from finding the probability that a customer did not purchase gasoline, given that the customer did not purchase a beverage.

{3}------------------------------------------------

Choice C is incorrect and may result from finding the probability that a customer did purchase a beverage, given that the customer did not purchase gasoline.

A total of 25 men registered for singing lessons. The frequency table shows how many of these singers have certain voice types. If one of these singers is selected at random, what is the probability he is a baritone?

A. 0.10

B. 0.40

C. 0.60

D. 0.67

#### ID: 16cea46c Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. This probability is calculated by dividing the number of baritone singers by the total number of men registered for singing lessons. It's given that a total of 25 men registered for singing lessons and that there are 10 baritones. Therefore, the probability of selecting a baritone from this group at random is 10

25 , which is equivalent to 0.40.

Choice A is incorrect. This would be the probability of selecting a baritone at random if there were 100 total men who registered for singing lessons. Choice C is incorrect. This is the probability of selecting a singer at random who isn't a baritone. Choice D is incorrect. This would be the probability of selecting a baritone at random if there were 15 total men registered for singing lessons.

|----------------------------|-------|---------|
| Play a school sport        | 312   | 220     |
| Do not play a school sport |       | 216     |

How many of the males surveyed responded that they do not play a school sport?

A. 109

B. 252

- C. 468
- D. 688

#### ID: b680e76d Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. The table summarizes all 1,000 responses from the students surveyed. If 312 are males who play a sport, 220 are females who play a sport, and 216 are females who do not play a sport, then 1,000 – 312 – 220 – 216 = 252 males who do not play a sport.

Choices A, C, and D are incorrect. If 109 males who do not play a sport responded, then the table summary would be 109 + 312 + 220 + 216 = 857 total student responses rather than 1,000. If 468 males who do not play a sport responded, then the table summary would be 468 + 312 + 220 + 216 total student responses rather than 1,000. If 688 males who do not play a sport responded, then the table summary would be 688 + 312 + 220 + 216 = 1,436 total student responses rather than 1,000.

- 

ID: 60caadfd Answer

Correct Answer: D

### Rationale

Choice D is correct. If one of the rocks in the collection is selected at random, the probability of selecting a rock that is igneous is equal to the number of igneous rocks in the collection divided by the total number of rocks in the collection. According to the table, there are 10 igneous rocks in the collection, and it's given that there's a total of 70 rocks in the collection. Therefore, if one of the collection is selected at random, the probability of selecting a rock that is igneous is =

Choice A is incorrect. This is the number of igneous rocks in the collection divided by the number of sedimentary rocks in the collection, not divided by the total number of rocks in the collection.

Choice B is incorrect. This is the number of igneous rocks in the collection divided by the number of metamorphic rocks in the collection, not divided by the total number of rocks in the collection.

Choice C is incorrect. This is the number of igneous rocks in the collection divided by the number of rocks in the collection that aren't igneous, not divided by the total number of rocks in the collection.

A data set of three numbers is shown. If a number from this data set is selected at random, what is the probability of selecting a negative number?

A. 0 B. J C. D. 1

#### ID: 0a99e5bb Answer

#### Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is correct. If a number from the data set is selected at random, the probability of selecting a negative number is the count of negative numbers in the data set divided by the total count of numbers in the data set. It's given that a data set of three numbers is shown. It follows that the total count of numbers in the data set shown, -13 is the only neqative number. It follows that the count of negative numbers in the data set is 1. Therefore, if a number from the data set is selected at random, the probability of selecting a negative number is -

Choice A is incorrect. This is the probability of selecting a negative number from a data set that doesn't contain any negative numbers.

Choice C is incorrect. This is the probability of selecting a positive number, from the data set.

Choice D is incorrect. This is the probability of selecting a negative number from a data set that contains only negative numbers.
