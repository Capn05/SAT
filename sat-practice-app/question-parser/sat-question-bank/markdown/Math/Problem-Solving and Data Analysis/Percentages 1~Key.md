The cost of a certain shirt is \$20 before a 5% sales tax is added. What is the total cost, including sales tax, to purchase the shirt?

| A. | \$20.05 |  |
|----|---------|--|
|----|---------|--|

B. \$20.50

C. \$21.00

D. \$25.00

#### ID: 8705ecba Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is correct. The total cost to purchase the shirt is the \$20 cost of the shirt plus the 5% sales tax. The value of the 5% sales tax on the \$20 shirt is equivalent to(0.05)(\$ 20), or \$1. Therefore, the total cost to

purchase the shirt is \$20+ \$ 1, or \$21.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from neglecting to multiply by \$20 when finding the value of the sales tax. Choice B is incorrect and may result from dividing by 10, instead of by 100, and then neglecting to multiply by \$20 when finding the sales tax. Choice D is incorrect and may result from interpreting the sales tax of 5% as \$5.

- A. 89h
- B. 0.089h
- C. 8.9h
- D. 0.89h

#### ID: 949cd96b Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. It's given that the length of the parallelogram is 89% of the height of the parallelogram. Since h is the height of the parallelogram, it follows that the length of the base of the parallelogram can be represented by the expression - 90%, or 0.89%.

Choice A is incorrect. This expression represents 8,900%, not 89%, of the height of the parallelogram.

Choice B is incorrect. This expression represents 8.9%, of the height of the parallelogram.

Choice C is incorrect. This expression represents 890%, of the height of the parallelogram.

A. 865

B. 887

C. 912

D. 926

#### ID: 28c6bd8c Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is correct. According to the table, 63% of survey respondents get most of their medical information from a doctor and 13% get most of their medical information from the Internet. Therefore, 76% of the 1,200 survey respondents get their information from either a doctor or the Internet, and 76% of 1,200 is 912.

Choices A, B, and D are incorrect. According to the table, 76% of survey respondents get their information from either a doctor or the Internet. Choice A is incorrect because 865 is about 72% (the percent of survey respondents who get most of their medical information from a doctor or from magazines/brochures), not 76%, of 1,200. Choice B is incorrect because 887 is about 74%, not 76%, of 1,200. Choice D is incorrect because 926 is about 77%, not 76%, of 1,200.

B. 15

C. 48

D. 72

## ID: 7ed0d098 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. There are 60 minutes in one hour, so an 8-hour workday has (60)(8) = 480 minutes. To calculate 15% of 480, multiply 0.15 by 480. (0.15)(480) = 72. Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings.

Choice A is incorrect because 1.2 is 15% of 8, which gives the time Lani spent of her workday in meetings in hours, not minutes. Choices B and C are incorrect and may be the result of computation errors.

A supervisor at a call center reviewed 500 calls taken by four employees and rated the employees' performance on each call on a scale from 1 star to 4 stars. The ratings for each employee are shown in the table above. According to the table, to the nearest whole percent, what percent of Employee A's calls received a rating of 1 star?

A. 3%

B. 11%

C. 16%

D. 32%

#### ID: 2d31caae Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. The percent of Employee A's calls that received a rating of 1 star is the number of Employee 16 A's 1-star calls divided by the total number of Employee A's calls. This quotient, 145 , is approximately equal to 0.1103, or 11.03%. To the nearest whole percent, this is 11%.

Choice A is incorrect. This is the percent of all calls taken by Employee A that received a rating of 1 star. Choice C is incorrect and may result from a conceptual error. For example, 16 is the number, not the percent, of calls taken by Employee A that received a rating of 1 star. Choice D is incorrect. This is the percent of all calls that received a rating of 1 star that were taken by Employee A.

There were approximately 113,000 occupational therapy jobs in the United States in 2012. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has projected that this number will increase by 29% from 2012 to 2022. Of the following, which is closest to the number of occupational therapy jobs the bureau has projected for the United States in 2022?

A. 115,900

B. 116,300

C. 142,000

- D. 145,800
### ID: 194ae3b1 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. The decimal equivalent of 29% is 0.29. It's given that the 113,000 occupational therapy jobs in the United States in 2012 are projected to increase by 29% by 2022. Increasing 113,000 by 29% can be expressed as (113,000)(1 +0.29), or (113,000)(1.29). Evaluating this expression yields 145,770. The closest number is 145,800 in choice D.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from increasing 113,000 by 2,900 instead of by 29%. Choice B is incorrect and may result from increasing 113,000 by 2.9% instead of by 29%. Choice C is incorrect and may result from increasing 113,000 by 29,000 instead of by 29%.

A waiter receives tips from each customer. On average, the tip is 15% of the customer's bill. At this rate, which of the following is closest to the tip the waiter can expect when a customer has a bill that is \$78.20?

A. \$8.00

B. \$10.00

C. \$12.00

D. \$14.00

#### ID: a8fabad0 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is correct. If the bill is \$78.20, 15% of the bill can be found by multiplying 78.20 by the decimal conversion of 15%, 78.20 × 0.15 = \$11.73. The exact amount \$11.73 is closest in value to \$12.00.

Choices A, B, and D are incorrect and may be the result of errors when calculating 15% of the total \$78.20.

What number is 20% greater than 60 ?

A. 50

B. 72

C. 75

D. 132

### ID: 41b71b4e Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. The decimal equivalent of 20% is 0.2. The number that is 20% greater than 60 is also 120% of 60. The decimal equivalent of 120% is 1.2, and 1.2(60) = 72.

Alternate approach: 10% of 60 is 6, and 20% of 60 is double that amount, or 12. It follows that is 20% greater than 60 is 12 more than 60, or 60 + 12 = 72.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from dividing, instead of multiplying, 60 by 1.2. Choice C is incorrect because it's 25% greater than 20% greater than 60. Choice D is incorrect and may result from multiplying 60 by 2.2 instead of 1.2.

21 is 21% of what number?

- A. 0
- B. 1
- C. 42
- D. 100

### ID: 93724cc6 Answer

#### Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is correct. Let x represent the number that 21 is 21% of. It follows that 21 = 2. Multiplying each side of this equation by x yields 21 = 20. Multiplying each side of this equation by 100 yields 2,100 = 21x. Dividing each side of this equation by 21 yields 100 = x. Therefore, 21 is 21% of 100.

Choice A is incorrect. 21% of 0 is 0, not 21. Choice B is incorrect. 21% of 1 is 0.21, not 21.

Choice C is incorrect. 21% of 42 is 8.82, not 21.
