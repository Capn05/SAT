A study was done on the weights of different types of fish in a pond. A random sample of fish were caught and marked in order to ensure that none were weighed more than once. The sample contained 150 largemouth bass, of which 30% weighed more than 2 pounds. Which of the following conclusions is best supported by the sample data?

A. The majority of all fish in the pond weigh less than 2 pounds.

- B. The average weight of all fish in the pond is approximately 2 pounds.
- C. Approximately 30% of all fish in the pond weigh more than 2 pounds.
- D. Approximately 30% of all largemouth bass in the pond weigh more than 2 pounds.

### ID: 53d97af5 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. The sample of 150 largemouth bass was selected at random from all the largemouth bass in the pond, and since 30% of the fish in the sample weighed more than 2 pounds, it can be concluded that approximately 30% of all largemouth bass in the pond weigh more than 2 pounds.

Choices A, B, and C are incorrect. Since the sample contained 150 largemouth bass, of which 30% weighed more than 2 pounds, this result can be generalized only to largemouth bass in the pond, not to all fish in the pond.

A park ranger asked a random sample of visitors how far they hiked during their visit. Based on the responses, the estimated mean was found to be 4.5 miles, with an associated margin of error of 0.5 miles. Which of the following is the best conclusion from these data?

A. It is likely that all visitors hiked between 4 and 5 miles.

B. It is likely that most visitors hiked exactly 4.5 miles.

C. It is not possible that any visitor hiked less than 3 miles.

D. It is plausible that the mean distance hiked for all visitors is between 4 and 5 miles.

### ID: f8f79e11 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. The qiven estimated mean has an associated marqin of error because from sample data, the population mean can't be determined precisely. Rather, from the sample mean, an interval can be determined within which it's plausible that the population's mean is likely to lie. Since the estimated mean is 4.5 miles with an associated margin of error of 0.5 miles, it follows that between 4.5 – 0.5

miles, or between 4 and 5 miles, is plausibly the mean distance hiked for all visitors.

Choices A, B, and C are incorrect. Based on the estimated mean, no determination can be made about the number of miles hiked for all visitors to the park.

A sample consisting of 720 adults who own televisions was selected at random for a study. Based on the sample, it is estimated that 32% of all adults who own televisions to watch nature shows, with an associated margin of error of 3.41%. Which of the following is the most plausible conclusion about all adults who own televisions?

- A. More than 35.41% of all adults who own televisions use their televisions to watch nature shows.
- B. Between 28.59% and 35.41% of all adults who own televisions to watch nature shows.
- C. Since the sample included adults who own televisions and not just those who use their televisions to watch nature shows, no conclusion can be made.
- D. Since the sample did not include all the people who watch nature shows, no conclusion can be made.

#### ID: e03f3477 Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is correct. It's qiven that based on a sample selected at random, it's estimated that 32% of all adults who own televisions use their televisions to watch nature shows, with an associated margin of 3.41%. Subtracting the margin of error from the estimate and adding the margin of error to the estimate gives an interval of plausible values for the true percentage of adults who own televisions to watch nature shows. This means it's plausible that between 32% - 3.41%, or 28.59%, and 32% + 3.41%, or 35.41%, of all adults who own televisions use their televisions to watch nature shows. Therefore, of the given choices, the most plausible conclusion is that between 28.59% and 35.41% of all adults who own televisions use their televisions to watch nature shows.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual errors.

Choice C is incorrect. To make a plausion about all adults who own televisions, the sample must be selected at random from all adults who own televisions, not just their televisions to watch nature shows.

Choice D is incorrect. Since the sample was selected at random from all adults who own televisions, a plausible conclusion can be made about all adults who own televisions.

A bag containing 10,000 beads of assorted colors is purchased from a craft store. To estimate the percent of red beads in the bag, a sample of beads is selected at random. The percent of red beads in the bag was estimated to be 15%, with an associated margin of error of 2%. If r is the actual number of red beads in the bag, which of the following is most plausible?

A. r > 1,700

B. 1,300 < r < 1,700

C. 200 < r < 1,500

D. r < 1,300

#### ID: fc46af57 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. It was estimated that 15% of the beads in the bag contains 10,000 beads, it follows that there are an estimated 10,000 x 0.15 = 1,500 red beads. It's given that the margin of error is 2%, or 10,000×0.02 = 200 beads. If the estimate is too high, there could plausibly be 1,500 – 200 = 1,300 red beads. If the estimate is too low, there could plausibly be 1,500 + 200 = 1,700 red beads. Therefore, the most plausible statement of the actual number of red beads in the bag is 1,300 < r < 1,700

Choices A and D are incorrect and may result from misinterpreting the margin of error. It's unlikely that more than 1,700 beads or fewer than 1,300 beads in the bag are red. Choice C is incorrect because 200 is the margin of error for the number of red beads, not the lower bound of the range of red beads.

A store manager reviewed the receipts from 80 customers who were selected at random from all the customers who made purchases last Thursday. Of those selected, 20 receipts showed that the customer had purchased fruit. If 1,500 customers made purchases last Thursday, which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion?

A. Exactly 75 customers must have purchased fruit last Thursday.

- B. Exactly 375 customers must have purchased fruit last Thursday.
C. The best estimate for the number of customers who purchased fruit last Thursday is 75.

- D. The best estimate for the number of customers who purchased fruit last Thursday is 375.
### ID: 89f8d08a Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. It's given that the manager took a random selection of the receipts of 80 customers from a total of 1,500. It's also given that of those 80 receipts, 20 showed that the customer had purchased fruit. This

20 means that an appropriate estimate of the fraction of customers who purchased fruit is 80 , or

Multiplying this fraction by the total number of customers yields Therefore, the best estimate for the number of customers who purchased fruit is 375.

Choices A and B are incorrect because an exact number of customers can't be known from taking a random selection. Additionally, choice A may also be the result of a calculation error. Choice C is incorrect and may result from a calculation error.

A random sample of 400 town voters were asked if they plan to vote for Candidate A or Candidate B for mayor. The results were sorted by gender and are shown in the table below.

|        | Plan to   | Plan to   |  |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--|
|        | vote for  | vote for  |  |
|        | Candidate | Candidate |  |
|        | A         | B         |  |
| Female | 202       | 20        |  |
| Male   | 34        | 144       |  |

The town has a total of 6,000 voters. Based on the table, what is the best estimate of the number of voters who plan to vote for Candidate A?

#### ID: 9ee22c16 Answer

Rationale

The correct answer is 3,540. According to the table, of 400 voters randomly sampled, the total number of men and women who plan to vote for Candidate A is 202 + 34 = 236. The best estimate of the total number of

voters in the town who plan to vote for Candidate A is the fraction of voters in the sample who plan to vote for 236

Candidate A, 400 , multiplied by the total voter population of 6000. Therefore, the answer is

(6,000) = 3,540
