Of the following, which is the best model for the data in the scatterplot?

$$\mathbb{A} \cdot \mathbb{Y} = \mathbb{Z}x^2 - \mathbb{1}\mathbb{1}x - \mathbb{Z}0$$

- B. y = 2x2-11x +20

$$\text{C. } \chi = 2x^2 - 5\chi - 3\chi$$

- D. y = 2x2-5x+3
### ID: 82aaa0a1 Answer

Correct Answer: B

## Rationale

Choice B is correct. The graphical model that most closely fits the data in the scatterplot is a model in which the number of data points above and below the model are approximately balanced. Fitting a graphical model to the data shown results in an upward-facing parabola with a y-intercept near (0,20) and a vertex with an

approximate x-value of 2.5. Of the given choices, only choice B gives an equation of an upward-facing parabola with a y-intercept at (0,20). Furthermore, substituting 2.5 for x into the equation in choice B yields y =5. This is approximately the y-value of the vertex of the model.

Choices A, C, and D are incorrect. These equations don't give a graphical model that best fits the data. At X = 0, they have y-values of – 20, – 3, and 3, respectively. At x = 2,5, they have y-values of – 3, and 3, respectively.

In an experiment, a heated cup of coffee is removed from a heat source, and the cup of coffee is then left in a room that is kept at a constant temperature. The graph above shows the temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit (°F), of the coffee immediately after being removed from the heat source and at 10-minute intervals thereafter. During which of the following 10-minute intervals does the temperature of the coffee decrease at the greatest average rate?

#### A. Between 0 and 10 minutes

- B. Between 30 and 40 minutes
- C. Between 50 and 60 minutes
- D. Between 90 and 100 minutes

### ID: 83272c51 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. The average rate of change in temperature of the coffee in degrees Fahrenheit per minute is calculated by dividing the difference between two recorded temperatures by the number of minutes in the corresponding interval of time. Since the time intervals given are all 10 minutes, the average rate of change is greatest for the points with the greatest difference in temperature. Of the choices, the greatest difference in temperature occurs between 0 and 10 minutes.

Choices B, C, and D are incorrect and may result from misinterpreting the average rate of change from the graph.

The scatterplot above shows the high temperature on a certain day and the elevation of 8 different locations in the Lake Tahoe Basin. A line of best fit for the data is also shown. What temperature is predicted by the line of best fit for a location in the Lake Tahoe Basin with an elevation of 8,500 feet?

A. 37°F

B. 39°F

C. 41°F

D. 43°F

## ID: ac5b6558 Answer

Correct Answer: B

### Rationale

Choice B is correct. The line of best fit passes through the point (8,500, 39). Therefore, the line of best fit predicts a temperature of 39°F for a location in Lake Tahoe Basin with an elevation of 8,500 feet.

Choice A is incorrect. This is the lowest temperature listed on the scatterplot, and the line of best fit never crosses this value for any of the elevations shown. Choice C is incorrect. According to the line of best fit, the temperature of 41°F is predicted for an elevation of slightly greater than 7,500 feet, not an elevation of 8,500 feet. Choice D is incorrect. According to the line of best fit, the temperature of 43°F is predicted for an elevation of roughly 6,700 feet, not an elevation of 8,500 feet.

A. Theresa ran at a constant speed for five minutes.

B. Theresa's speed was increasing for a longer period of time than it was decreasing.

- C. Theresa's speed decreased at a constant rate during the last five minutes.
- D. Theresa's speed reached its maximum during the last ten minutes.

### ID: 9d88a3e3 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. Theresa's speed was increasing from 0 to 5 minutes and from 20 to 25 minutes, which is a total of 10 minutes. Theresa's speed was decreasing from 10 minutes and from 25 to 30 minutes, which is a total of 15 minutes. Theresa's speed was NOT increasing for a longer period of time than it was decreasing.

Choice A is incorrect. Theresa ran at a constant speed for the 5-minute period from 5 to 10 minutes. Choice C is incorrect.

According to the line graph above, between which two consecutive years was there the greatest change in the number of 3-D movies released?

- A. 2003-2004
- B. 2008-2009
- C. 2009-2010
- D. 2010-2011

### ID: a6b2fcce Answer

Correct Answer: D

### Rationale

Choice D is correct. The change in the number of 3-D movies released between any two consecutive years can be found by first estimating the number of 3-D movies released for each of the two years and then finding the positive difference between these two estimates. Between 2003 and 2004, this change is approximately 2 – 2 = 0 movies; between 2008 and 2009; this change is approximately 20 – 8 = 12 movies; between 2009 and 2010, this change is approximately 26–20 = 6 movies; and between 2010 and 2011, this change is approximately 46 – 26 = 20 movies. Therefore, of the pairs of consecutive years in the choices, the greatest increase in the number of 3-D movies released occurred during the time period between 2010 and 2011.

Choices A, B, and C are incorrect. Between 2010 and 2011, approximately 20 more 3-D movies were released. The change in the number of 3-D movies released between any of the other pairs of consecutive years is significantly smaller than 20.

B.y = - x - 6

C. y = 6x + 1

D. y = 6x - 1

## ID: 9296553d Answer

Correct Answer: A

### Rationale

Choice A is correct. A line of best fit for the data in a scatterplot is a line that follows the trend of the data with approximately half the data points above and half the data points below the line. Based on the given data, a line of best fit will have a positive y-intercept on or near the point (0,6) and a negative slope. All of the choices are in slope-intercept form y = mx + b, where m is the y-coordinate of the y-coordinate of the y-intercept. Only choice A is an equation of a line with a positive y-intercept at (0,6) and a negative slope, — 1.

Choice B is incorrect. This equation is for a line that has a negative y-intercept, not a positive y-intercept. Choices C and D are incorrect and may result from one or more sign errors and from switching the values of the y-intercept and the slope in the equation.

The graph above shows the relationship between the speed of a particular car, in miles per hour, and its corresponding braking distance, in feet. Approximately how many feet greater will the car's braking distance be when the car is traveling at 50 miles per hour than when the car is traveling at 30 miles per hour?

A. 75

B. 125

C. 175

D. 250

#### ID: d6121490 Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is correct. According to the graph, when the car is traveling at 50 miles per hour, the braking distance is approximately 225 feet, and when the car is traveling at 30 miles per hour, the braking distance is approximately 100 feet. The difference between these braking distances is 225 - 100, or 125 feet.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from finding the braking distance for 20 miles per hour, the difference between the qiven speeds. Choice C is incorrect and may result from subtracting the speed from the braking distance at 50 miles per hour. Choice D is incorrect and may result from finding the difference in the braking distances at 60 and 20 miles per hour.

A. From x = 6 to x = 7

- B. From x = 5 to x = 6
- C. From x = 2 to x = 3
- D. From x = 1 to x = 2

#### ID: d112bc9d Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is correct. The scatterplot shows that there was an increase in recorded temperature from x = 2 to x = 3 and from x = 6 to x = 7. When x = 2, the recorded temperature was approximately 60 °F and when x = 3, the recorded temperature was greater than 70 °F. This means that the increase in recorded temperature from x = 2 to x = 3 was greater than (70 - 60) F, or 10 F. When x = 6, the recorded temperature was greater than 60 °F and when x = 7, the recorded temperature was less than 70 °F. This

{11}------------------------------------------------

means that the increase in recorded temperature from x = 6 to x = 7 was less than (70 = 60) °F, or 10 °F. It follows that the greatest increase in recorded temperature took place from x = 2 to x = 3.

Choice A is incorrect. The increase in recorded temperature from x = 6 to x = 7 was less than the increase in recorded temperature from x = 2 to x = 3.

Choice B is incorrect. From x = 5 to x = 6, a decrease, not an increase, in recorded temperature took place.

Choice D is incorrect. From x = 1 to x = 2, a decrease, not an increase, in recorded temperature took place.

What was the weight, to the nearest pound, of all nectarines that grew on the tree during the 4th growing season after the tree's transplantation?

### ID: b58dbf88 Answer

#### Correct Answer: 40

### Rationale

The correct answer is 40. For each data point on the scatterplot, the x-value represents the growing season after transplantation and the y-value represents the weight, in pounds, of all nectarines that grew on the season. The scatterplot shows a data point at 4, 40. It follows that during the 4th growing season after the tree's transplantation, 40 pounds of nectarines grew on the tree.
