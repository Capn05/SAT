l A. 7 2 B. 7 l c. 3 4 D. 7

### ID: b1b5300b Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. It's given that there are 2 hybrid cars priced at no more than \$25,000. It's also given that there are 14 cars total for sale. Therefore, the probability of selecting a hybrid priced at no more than \$25,000 when one car is chosen at random is 14 7 .

Choice B is incorrect. This is the probability of selecting a hybrid car priced greater than \$25,000 when choosing one car at random. Choice C is incorrect. This is the probability, when choosing randomly from only the hybrid cars, of selecting one priced at no more than \$25,000. Choice D is incorrect. This is the probability of selecting a hybrid car when selecting at random from only the cars priced greater than \$25,000.

If one of these state parks is selected at random, what is the probability that it has camping facilities but does not have bicycle paths?

#### ID: 0301c5dc Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. The total number of state parks in the state is 20+5+8+4 = 37. According to the table, 5 of these have camping facilities but not bicycle paths. Therefore, if a state park is selected at random, the 5 probability that it has camping facilities but not bicycle paths is 37

Choice B is incorrect. This is the probability that a state park selected at random from the state parks with camping facilities does not have bicycle paths. Choice C is incorrect. This is the probability that a state park selected at random from the state parks with bicycle paths does not have camping facilities. Choice D is incorrect. This is the probability that a state park selected at random from the state parks without bicycle paths does have camping facilities.

In a bag, there are 7 red, 4 white, 33 blue, and 33 yellow cubes. If one of these cubes is selected at random, what is the probability of selecting a cube that is neither blue nor yellow?

![](_page_5_Figure_5.jpeg)

ID: 0ae37ff3 Answer

Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is correct. It's given that there are 7 red, 4 white, 33 blue, and 33 yellow cubes in the bag. Therefore, there are a total of 7 + 4 + 33 + 33, or 77, cubes in the bag. If the cube is neither blue nor yellow, then it must be either red or white. Therefore, the probability of selecting a cube that is neither blue nor yellow is equivalent to the probability of selecting a cube that is either red or white. If one of these cubes is selected at random, the probability of selecting a cube that is either red or white is equal to the number of red cubes and white cubes divided by the total number of cubes in the bag. There are 7 red cubes, 4 white cubes, and 77 total cubes in the bag. Therefore, the probability of selecting a red or white cube is 12, which is equivalent to ¾, or ÷. Thus, if one cube is selected at random, the probability of selecting a cube that is neither blue nor yellow is =

Choice A is incorrect. This is the probability of selecting a cube that is either blue or yellow, rather than the probability of selecting a cube that is neither blue nor yellow.

Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

Each vertex of a 14-sided polygon is labeled with one of the 14 letters A through N, with a different letter at each vertex. If one vertex is selected at random, what is the probability that the letter D will be at the selected vertex? (Express your answer as a decimal or fraction, not as a percent.)

### ID: 2df8f293 Answer

Correct Answer: .0714, 1/14

Rationale

The correct answer is - If one vertex of the polygon is selected at random, the probability that the letter D will be at the selected vertex is equal to the number of vertices labeled with the letter D divided by the total number of vertices. It's given that each vertex is labeled with one of the 14 letters A through W, with a different letter at each vertex. It follows that there is 1 vertex labeled with the letter D. It's also given that the polygon is 14-sided. It follows that there are a total of 14 vertices. Thus, the probability that the letter D will be at the selected vertex is - - Note that 1/14, .0714, and 0.071 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer.

If one of the days on which there was no rain is selected at random, what is the probability the day was a weekend day?

4 A. 21 l B. 4 2 c. 3 3 D. 4

#### ID: 912cd125 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. There were 64 days with no rain. It was a weekend day for 16 of those 64 days. So 16 out of 64 of the days with no rain were weekend days. Because the day is selected at random, each day has an equal 16 1

chance of being selected, so the probability is 64 4 .

Choice A is incorrect. It is the probability that a day selected at random from any one of the 12 weeks is a weekend day with no rain. Choice C is incorrect. It is the probability that a day selected at random from the weekend days has no rain. Choice D is incorrect. It is the probability that a day selected at random from the days with no rain is a weekday.

At a conference, there are a total of 275 attendee is assigned to either group A, group B, or group C. If one of these attendees is selected at random, the probability of selecting an attendee who is assigned to group A is 0.44 and the probability of selecting an attendee who is assigned to group B is 0.24. How many attendees are assigned to group C?

#### ID: 30db8f77 Answer

Correct Answer: 88

#### Rationale

The correct answer is 88. It's given that there are a total of 275 attendees and each attendee is assigned to either group A, group B, or group C. It's also given that if one of these attendees is selected at random, the probability of selecting an attendee who is assigned to group A is 0.44 and the probability of selecting an attendee who is assigned to group B is 0.24. It follows that there are 0.44(275), or 121, attendees who are assigned to group A and 0.24(275), or 66, attendees who are assigned to group B. The number of attendees who are assioned to group C is the number of attendees who are not assigned to group A or group B. In other words, the number of attendees who are assigned to group C is the total number of attendees minus the number of attendees who are assigned to group B. Therefore, the number of attendees who are assigned to group C is 275 - 121 - 66, or 88.

| 10<br>-<br>C. 24 |
| 25<br>D. 34      |

## ID: b6569d0e Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is correct. The sample space is restricted to the presidents who were at least 50 years old when they first took office. Therefore, the sum of the values in the final four rows of the table, 13 + 1 + 7 + 3 = 34, is the

2.9

{11}------------------------------------------------

total number of presidents in the sample space. The number of presidents who were at least 60 years old is the sum of the values in the final two rows of the table: 7 + 3 = 10. Thus, the fraction of the 34 presidents who were

10

at least 50 years old when they first took office who were at least 60 years old is 34

Choice A is incorrect. This is the fraction of all presidents in the table who were at least 60 years old when they first took office. Choice C is incorrect and may result from treating the number of presidents who were between 50 and 59 years old when they first took office, instead of the number of presidents who were at least 50 years old, as the sample space. Choice D is incorrect and may result from a calculation error.
