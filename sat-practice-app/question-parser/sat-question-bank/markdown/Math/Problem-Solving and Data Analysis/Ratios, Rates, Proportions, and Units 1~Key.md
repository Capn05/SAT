weighs 100 pounds on Earth, then the object's weight on Venus is approximately 10 (100) = 90 pounds. The 23 same object's weight on Jupiter is approximately 10 of its weight on Earth; therefore, the object weighs 23

(100) = 230 approximately 10 the object's weight on Venus is approximately 230 – 90 = 140 pounds. Therefore, an object that weighs 100 pounds on Earth weighs 140 more pounds on Jupiter than it weighs on Venus.

Choice A is incorrect because it is the weight, in pounds, of the object on Venus. Choice B is incorrect because it is the weight, in pounds, of an object on Earth if it weighs 100 pounds on Venus. Choice D is incorrect because it is the weight, in pounds, of the object on Jupiter.

To make a bakery's signature chocolate muffins, a baker needs 2.5 ounces of chocolate for each muffin. How many pounds of chocolate are needed to make 48 signature chocolate muffins? (1 pound = 16 ounces)

A. 7.5

B. 10

C. 50.5

D. 120

### ID: 06a152cd Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. If 2.5 ounces of chocolate are needed for each muffin, then the number of ounces of chocolate needed to make 48 muffins is 48×2.5 = 120 ounces. Since 1 pound = 16 ounces, the number of 120 = 7.5 pounds that is equivalent to 120 ounces is 16 pounds. Therefore, 7.5 pounds of chocolate are needed to

make the 48 muffins.

Choice B is incorrect. If 10 pounds of chocolate were needed to make 48 muffins, then the total number of ounces of chocolate needed would be 10 x 16 = 160 ounces. The number of ounces of chocolate per muffin

160 would then be 48 ounces per muffin, not 2.5 ounces per muffin. Choices C and D are also incorrect. Following the same procedures as used to test choice B gives 16.8 ounces per muffin for choice C and 40 ounces per muffin for choice D, not 2.5 ounces per muffin. Therefore, 50.5 and 120 pounds cannot be the number of pounds needed to make 48 signature chocolate muffins.

Marta has 7,500 pesos she will convert to US dollars using a currency exchange service. At this time, the currency exchange rate is 1 peso = 0.075 US dollars. The exchange service will charge Marta a 2% fee on the converted US dollar amount. How many US dollars will Marta receive from the currency exchange after the 2% fee is applied?

- A. \$551 .25 B. \$562 .50
- C. \$5,625 .00
- D. \$98,000

.00

### ID: 3ac09984 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. At the exchange rate of 1 peso = 0.075 US dollars, 7,500 pesos would be converted to 7,500 × 0.075 = \$562.50. However, since Maria pays a 2% fee on the converted US dollar amount, she receives only (100 – 2)%, or 98%, of the converted US dollars, and 562.50 × 0.98 = \$551.25.

Choice B is incorrect. This is the number of US dollars Maria would receive if the exchange service did not charge a 2% fee. Choice C is incorrect and may result from a decimal point error made when calculating the conversion to US dollars and from not assessing the 2% fee. Choice D is incorrect and may result from reversing the units of the exchange rate.

Makayla is planning an event in a 5,400-square-foot room. If there should be at least 8 square feet per person, what is the maximum number of people that could attend this event?

A. 588

B. 675

C. 15,274

D. 43,200

### ID: 99550621 Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is correct. It's given that the event will be in a 5,400-square-foot room and that there should be at least 8 square feet per person. The maximum number of people that could attend the event can be found by dividing the total square feet in the minimum number of square feet needed per person, which

5,400 =675 gives 8

Choices A and C are incorrect and may result from conceptual or computational errors. Choice D is incorrect and may result from multiplying, rather than dividing, 5,400 by 8.

The ratio of the length of line segment XV to the length of line segment ZV is 6 to 1. If the length of line segment XX is 102 inches, what is the length, in inches, of line segment ZV?

A. 17

B. 96

c. 102

D. 612

## ID: da9ffcf6 Answer

### Correct Answer: A

## Rationale

Choice A is correct. It's given that the ratio of line segment XY to the length of line segment ZV is 6 1, which means 4 = 9. It's given that the length of line segment XY is 102 inches. If the length, in inches, of line segment ZV is represented by I, the value of I can be calculated by solving the equation 192 = 9, or 102 = 6. Multiplying each side of this equation by I yields 102 = 6. Dividing each side of this equation by 6 yields 17 = 1. Therefore, the length of line segment ZV is 17 inches.

Choice B is incorrect. This is the length, in inches, of line segment 2V ine segment XY is 576, not 102, inches.

Choice C is incorrect. This is the length, in inches, of line segment XY, not line segment ZV.

Choice D is incorrect. This is the length, in inches, of line segment ZV if the ratio of the length of line segment XY to the length of line segment ZV is 1 to 6, not 6 to 1.
