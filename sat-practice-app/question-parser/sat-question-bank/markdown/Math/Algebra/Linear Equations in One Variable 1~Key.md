What value of p satisfies the equation 5p + 180 = 250?

A. 14

B. 65

C. 86

D. 250

### ID: 097e10f5 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. Subtracting 180 from both sides of the given equation yields 5p = 70. Dividing both sides of this equation by 5 yields p = 14. Therefore, the value of p that satisfies the equation 5p + 180 = 250 is 14.

Choice B is incorrect. This value of p satisfies the equation 5p + 180 = 505.

Choice C is incorrect. This value of p satisfies the equation 5p + 180 = 610.

Choice D is incorrect. This value of p satisfies the equation 5p + 180 = 1,430.

The perimeter of an isosceles triangle is 83 inches. Each of the triangle has a length of 24 inches. What is the length, in inches, of the third side?

#### ID: 997bec28 Answer

Correct Answer: 35

Rationale

The correct answer is 35. It's given that the perimeter of an isosceles triangle is 83 inches and that each of the two congruent sides has a length of 24 inches. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides. The equation 24 + 24 + x = 83 can be used to represent this situation, where x is the length, in inches, of the third side. Combining like terms on the left-hand side of this equation yields 48 + x = 83. Subtracting 48 from both sides of this equation yields x = 35. Therefore, the length, in inches, of the third side is 35.

One pound of grapes costs \$2. At this rate, how many dollars will c pounds of grapes cost?

A. 2c B. 2+c 2 C. c C D. 2

### ID: 93954cfa Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. If one pound of grapes costs \$2, two pounds of grapes will cost 2 times \$2, three pounds of grapes will cost 3 times \$2, and so on. Therefore, c pounds of grapes will cost c times \$2, which is 2c dollars.

Choice B is incorrect and may result from incorrectly adding instead of multiplying. Choice C is incorrect and may result from assuming that c pounds cost \$2, and then finding the cost per pound. Choice D is incorrect and could result from incorrectly assuming that 2 pounds cost \$c, and then finding the cost per pound.

ID: 3d04de9c Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. It's given that a principal used a total of 25 blue flags and yellow flags. It's also given that of the 25 flags used, 20 flags were blue. Subtracting the number of blue flags used from the total number of flags used results in the number of yellow flags used. It follows that the number of yellow flags used is 25 - 20 , or 5.

Choice B is incorrect. This is the number of blue flags used.

Choice C is incorrect. This is the total number of flags used.

Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

How many solutions exist to the equation shown above?

A. None

B. Exactly 1

C. Exactly 3

D. Infinitely many

### ID: 550b352c Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. Subtracting 4 from each side of the given equation yields 6 = 2χ, or X = 3, so the equation has a unique solution of x = 3.

Choice A is incorrect. Since 3 is a value of x that satisfies the given equation has at least 1 solution. Choice C is incorrect. Linear equations can have 0, 1, or infinitely many solutions; no linear equation has exactly 3 solutions. Choice D is incorrect. If a linear equation has infinitely many solutions, it can be reduced to () = (). This equation reduces to x = 3, so there is only 1 solution.

| D. 10 |  |  |
|       |  |  |

### ID: 12255364 Answer

Correct Answer: C

### Rationale

Choice C is correct. It's given that a gym charges its members a onetime \$36 enrollment fee and a membership fee of \$19 per month. Let x represent the number of months at the gym after which a member will have been charged a total of \$188. If there are no charges other than the enrollment fee and the membership fee, the equation 36 + 19x = 188 can be used to represent this situation. Subtracting 36 from both sides of this equation yields 19x = 152. Dividing both sides of this equation by 19 yields x = 8. Therefore, a member will have been charged a total of \$188 after 8 months at the gym.

Choice A is incorrect. A member will have been charged a total of \$(36 + 19 × 4), or \$112, after 4 months at the gym.

Choice B is incorrect. A member will have been charged a total of \$(36 + 19 × 5), or \$131, after 5 months at the gym.

Choice D is incorrect. A member will have been charged a total of \$(36 + 19 × 10), or \$226, after 10 months at the gym.

For what value of w does w-10=2(w+5) ?

A. 5 B. 0 C. -15

D. - 20

### ID: d9d83c02 Answer

Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is correct. To solve the equation, use the distributive property to multiply on the right-hand side of the equation which gives w – 10 = 2w + 10. Subtract w from both sides of the equation, which gives – 10 = w + 10. Finally, subtract 10 from both sides of the equation, which gives –20 = w.

Choices A and B are incorrect and may result from making sign errors. Choice C is incorrect and may result from incompletely distributing the 2 in the expression 2(w + 5).

2n = 10 , what is the 5 lf value of 2n – 1 ? A. 24 B. 49 C. 50 D. 99

#### ID: 7a987ae4 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. Multiplying both sides of the given equation by 5 yields 2n = 50. Substituting 50 for 2n in the expression 2n - 1 yields 50 - 1 = 49

Alternate approach: Dividing both sides of 2n = 50 by 2 yields n = 25. Evaluating the expression 2n = 1 for n = 25 yields 2(25) — 1 = 49.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from finding the value of n = 1 instead of 2n - 1. Choice C is incorrect and may result from finding the value of 2n instead of 2n – 1. Choice D is incorrect and may result from finding the value of 4n - 1 instead of 2n - 1.

#### ID: 9ff10b3b Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is correct. To make it easier to add like terms on the left-hand side of the given equation, both sides of l l the equation can be multiplied by 6, which is the lowest common denominator of 2 and 6 . This yields 3x - x = 6, which can be rewritten as 2x = 6. Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields x = 3.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from subtracting the denominators instead of numerators with common x, rather than 3 *, on the left-hand side of the equation. Choice B is incorrect and denominators to get 4 may result from rewriting the given equation as 2 6 instead of 2x = 6. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or computational errors.

A. 15

B. 18

C. 25

D. 29

#### ID: 46f68129 Answer

Rationale

On the first day of a semester, a film club has 90 members. Each day of the semester, 10 new members join the film club. If no members leave the film club, how many total members will the film club have 4 days after the first day of the semester?

A. 400

B. 130

C. 94

D. 90

### ID: 2e98b1df Answer

### Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is correct. It's given that the film club has 90 members on the first day of a semester, and 10 new members join the film club each day after the first day of the semester. This means that after 4 days, 4 x 10, or 40, new members will have joined the club. Adding 40 members to the original 90 club members. Thus, the film club will have 130 total members 4 days after the first day of the semester.

Choice A is incorrect. This is the numbers that will have joined the film club 4 days after the first day of the semester if 100 new members, not 10, join the film club each day.

Choice C is incorrect. This is the numbers the film club will have 4 days after the first day of the semester if 1 new member, not 10, joins the film club each day.

Choice D is incorrect. This is the number of members the film club has on the first day of the semester.

## If 3x = 30, what is the value of 3x - 12?

- A. —2
- B. 18
- c. 22
- D. 42

## ID: 40ba6288 Answer

#### Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is correct. Subtracting 12 from each side of the given equation yields 3x - 12 = 30 - 12, or 3x - 12 = 18. Therefore, the value of 3x - 12 is 18.

Choice A is incorrect. This is the value of x - 12, not 3x - 12. Choice C is incorrect. This is the value of x + 12, not 3x - 12.

Choice D is incorrect. This is the value of 3x + 12, not 3x - 12.
