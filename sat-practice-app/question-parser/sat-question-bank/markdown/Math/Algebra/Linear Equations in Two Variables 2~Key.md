On a 210-mile trip, Cameron drove at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for the first x hours. He then completed the trip, driving at an average speed of 50 miles per hour for the remaining y hours. If x = 1, what is the value of y ?

### ID: 9c7741c6 Answer

Rationale

The correct answer is 3. It's given that Cameron drove 60 miles per hour for x hours; therefore, the distance driven at this speed can be represented by 60x. He then drove 50 miles per hour for y hours; therefore, the distance driven at this speed can be represented by 50y. Since Cameron drove 210 total miles, the equation 60x +50y = 210 represents this situation. If x = 1, substitution yields 60(1) + 50y = 210, or 60 +50y = 210. Subtracting 60 from both sides of this equation yields 50y = 150. Dividing both sides of this equation by 50 yields y = 3

$$\sideset{_{B.}}{}{\mathop{P}}-\frac{\mathfrak{l}\mathfrak{l}}{3}\mathsf{s}+\mathfrak{s}$$

#### ID: d62ad380 Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is correct. The relationship between s and P can be modeled by a linear equation of the form P = ks + 10 a, where k and a are constants. The table shows that P increases by 10 when s increases by 3, so k = solve for a, substitute one of the given pairs of values for s and P: when s = 3, P = 8, so which yields a = −2. The solution is therefore

Choice A is incorrect. When s = 3, P = 8, but 3(3) + 10 = 19 + 8. Choice B is incorrect. This may result from using the first number given for P in the table as the constant term a in the linear equation P = ks + a, which is true only when s = 0. Choice D is incorrect and may result from using the reciprocal of the slope of the line.

In an article about exercise, it is estimated that a 160-pound adult uses 200 calories for every 30 minutes of hiking and 150 calories for every 30 minutes of bicycling. An adult who weighs 160 pounds has completed 1 hour of bicycling. Based on the article, how many hours should the adult hike to use a total of 1,900 calories from bicycling and hiking?

- A. 9.5
B. 8.75

C. 6

- D. 4
## ID: 431c3038 Answer

Correct Answer: D

### Rationale

Choice D is correct. Since a 160-pound adult uses 200 calories for every 30 minutes of hiking, then the same adult uses 200h calories after hiking for h 30-minute periods. Similarly, the same adult uses 150b calories after bicycling for b 30-minute periods. Therefore, the equation 200h + 150b = 1,900 represents the situation where a 160-pound adult uses a total of 1,900 calories from hiking for h 30-minute periods and bicycling for b 30-minute periods. It's given that the adult completes 1 hour, or 2 30-minute periods, of bicycling. Substituting 2 for b in the equation 200h + 150b = 1,900 yields 200h + 150(2) = 1,900, or 200h + 300 = 1,900 Subtracting 300 from both sides of this equation yields 200h = 1,600. Dividing both sides by 200 yields h = 8. Since h represents the number of 30-minute periods spent hiking and there are 2 30-minute periods in every a hour, it follows that the adult will need to hike for 2 , or 4 hours to use a total of 1,900 calories from bicycling and hiking.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from solving the equation 200h = 1,900. This represents 0 30-minute periods bicycling instead of 2. Choice B is incorrect and may result from solving the equation 200h + 150 = 1,900. This represents 1 30-minute period of bicycling instead of 2. Choice C is incorrect. This

may result from determining that the number of 30-minute periods the adult should hike is 8, but then subtracting 2 from 8, rather than dividing 8 by 2, to find the number of hours the adult should hike.

Characteristics for Rock Types

A city is planning to build a rock retaining wall, a monument, and a garden in a park. The table above shows four rock types that will be considered for use in the project. Also shown for each rock type is its weight per volume, in pounds per cubic foot (Ib/ft ), and the cost per pound, in dollars. Only basalt, granite, and limestone will be used in the garden. The rocks in the garden will have a total weight of 1,000 pounds. If 330 pounds of granite is used, which of the following equations could show the relationship between the amounts, x and y, in ft , for each of the other rock types used?

A. 165x +180y = 670

B. 165x +120y = 1,000

C. 120x +180y = 670

D. 120x +180y = 1,000

### ID: 28c2253f Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is correct. It's given that the weight of the granite used in the gargen is 330 pounds. The weight of the limestone used in the garden is a product of its weight per volume, in lb/ft , and its volume, in ft the weight of the limestone used in the garden can be represented by 120x, where x is the volume, in ft of

the limestone used. Similarly, the weight of the basalt used in the garden can be represented by 180y, where y

2.7

{8}------------------------------------------------

is the volume, in ft , of the basalt used. It's given that the total weight of the rocks used in the garden will be 1,000 pounds. Thus, the sum of the weights of the three rock types used is 1,000 pounds, which can be represented by the equation 120x + 180y + 330 = 1,000. Subtracting 330 from both sides of this equation

### yields 120x +180y = 670

Choice A is incorrect. This equation uses the weight per volume of granite instead of limestone. Choice B is incorrect. This equation uses the weight per volume of granite instead of basalt, and doesn't take into account the 330 pounds of granite that will be used in the garden. Choice D is incorrect. This equation doesn't take into account the 330 pounds of granite that will be used in the garden.

- C. Each side of figure A has a length of 6 inches.
- D. The number of sides of figure A is 6.

#### ID: 2e1a7f66 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. It's given that figure B (not shown) are both regular polygons and the sum of the perimeters of the two figures is 63 inches. It's also given that x is the number of sides of figure A and y is the number of sides of figure B, and that the equation 3x + 6y = 63 represents this situation. Thus, 3x and 6y represent the perimeters, in inches, of figure B, respectively. Since 6g represents the perimeter, in inches, of figure B and y is the number of sides of figure B, it follows that each side of figure B has a length of 6 inches.

Choice B is incorrect. The number of sides of figure B is y, not 6.

Choice C is incorrect. Since the perimeter, in inches, of figure A is represented by 3x, each side of figure A has a length of 3 inches, not 6 inches.

Choice D is incorrect. The number of sides of figure A is x, not 6.

- B. The difference, in centimeters, between the lengths of sides QR and RS
- C. The sum of the lengths, in centimeters, of the three sides of the triangle
- D. The length, in centimeters, of one of the two sides of equal length

#### ID: 400798d6 Answer

#### Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is correct. It's given that in triangle QRS, sides QR and RS each have a length of x centimeters. Therefore, the expression 2x represents the sum of the lengths, in centimeters, of sides QR and RS. It's also given that side SQ has a length of y centimeters. Therefore, the expression 2x + v represents the sum of the lengths, in centimeters, of sides QR, RS, and SQ. Since 2x + y is the sum of the lengths, in centimeters, of the triangle and 2x + y = 37, it follows that 37 is the sum of the lengths, in centimeters, of the three sides of the triangle.

Choice A is incorrect. The difference, in centimeters, between the lengths of sides QR and SQ is x - y, not 37.

Choice B is incorrect. The difference, in centimeters, between the lengths of sides QR and RS is x - x, or 0, not 37.

Choice D is incorrect. The length, in centimeters, of one of the two sides of equal length is x, not 37.

A. 6r + 24t = 210

B. 2r + 6t = 210

C. 8r + 18t = 210

D. 6r + 2t = 210

## ID: 62ef6f73 Answer

#### Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is correct. It's given that a total of 2 squares each have side length r. Therefore, each of the squares has perimeter 4r. Since there are a total of 2 squares, the sum of these squares is 4r + 4r, which is equivalent to 24; or 8r It's also given that a total of 6 equilateral triangles each have side length t. Therefore, each of the equilateral triangles has perimeter 3t. Since there are a total of 6 equilateral triangles, the sum of the perimeters of these triangles is 31 + 3t + 3t + 3t + 3t, which is equivalent to 63t, or 18t. Since the sum of the squares is 8r and the sum of the perimeters of the triangles is 18t, the sum of the perimeters of all these squares and triangles is 8r + 18t. It's qiven that the sum of the perimeters of all these squares and triangles is 210. Therefore, the equation 8r + 18t = 200 represents this situation.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

## ID: 92aa3a94 Answer

#### Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is correct. It's given that line k is defined by y = 7x + - . For an equation in slope-intercept form y = mx + b, m represents the slope of the line defined by this equation in the xy-plane and b represents the y-intercept of this line. Therefore, the slope of line k is 7. It's also given that line ¿ is perpendicular to line k in the xy-plane. Therefore, the slope of line j is the opposite reciprocal of the slope of line k. The opposite reciprocal of 7 is -- Therefore, the slope of line j is -1
is -7 -7 -

Choice A is incorrect. This is the opposite reciprocal of the y-intercept, not the slope, of line k.

Choice C is incorrect. This is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of line k, not the j.

Choice D is incorrect. This is the slope of a line that is parallel, not perpendicular, to line k.
