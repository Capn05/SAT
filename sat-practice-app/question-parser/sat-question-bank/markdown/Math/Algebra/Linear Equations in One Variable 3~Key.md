Hector used a tool called an auger to remove corn from a storage bin at a constant rate. The bin contained 24,000 bushels of corn when Hector began to use the auger. After 5 hours of using the auger, 19,350 bushels of corn remained in the bin. If the auger continues to remove corn at this rate, what is the total number of hours Hector will have been using the auger when 12,840 bushels of corn remain in the bin?

- A. 3 B. 7 C. 8 D. 12
### ID: 2937ef4f Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. After using the auger for 5 hours, Hector had removed 24,000 – 19,350 = 4,650 bushels of corn from the storage bin. During the 5-hour period, the auger removed corn from the bin at a constant rate of 4,650 = 930

bushels per hour. Assuming the auger continues to remove corn at this rate, after x hours it will 5

have removed 930x bushels of corn. Because the bin contained 24,000 bushels of corn when Hector started using the auger, the equation 24,000 – 930x = 12,840 can be used to find the number of hours, x, Hector will have been using the auger when 12,840 bushels of corn remain in the bin. Subtracting 12,840 from both sides of this equation and adding 930x to both sides of the equation yields 11,160 = 930x. Dividing both sides of this equation by 930 yields x = 12. Therefore, Hector will have been using the auger for 12 hours when 12,840 bushels of corn remain in the storage bin.

Choice A is incorrect. Three hours after Hector began using the auger, 24,000 – 3(930) = 21,210 bushels of corn remained, not 12,840. Choice B is incorrect. Seven hours after Hector began using the auger, 24,000 – 7(930) = 17,490 bushels of corn will remain, not 12,840. Choice C is incorrect. Eight hours after Hector began using the auger, 24,000 – 8(930) = 16,560 bushels of corn will remain, not 12,840.

3.2

Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by \$5. Assuming gasoline costs \$4 per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, m, he should drive each week?

$$\text{A. } \frac{25}{4}m = 95$$

$$\text{B. } \frac{25}{4}m = 5$$

$$\text{C. } \frac{4}{25}m = 95$$

$$\text{D. } \frac{4}{25}m = 5$$

#### ID: b7e6394d Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. Since qasoline costs \$4 per gallon, and since Alan's car travels an average of 25 miles per A A gallon, the expression 25 gives the cost, in dollars per mile, to drive the car. Multiplying 25 by m gives the 4 cost for Alan to drive m miles in his car. Alan wants to reduce his weekly spending by \$5, so setting 25 m equal to 5 gives the number of miles, m, by which he must reduce his driving.

Choices A, B, and C are incorrect. Choices A and B transpose the numerator and the denominator in the 75 fraction. The fraction 4 would result in the unit miles per dollar, but the question requires a unit of dollars per mile. Choices A and C set the expression equal to 95 instead of 5, a mistake that may result from a misconception that Alan wants to reduce his driving by 5 miles each week; instead, the question says he wants to reduce his weekly expenditure by \$5.

$$3\left(kx+13\right)=\frac{48}{17}x+36$$

In the given equation, I is a constant. The equation has no solution. What is the value of ½?

### ID: e6cb2402 Answer

Correct Answer: .9411, .9412, 16/17

Rationale

The correct answer is It's given that the equation 3(kx + 13) = equation in the form ax + b = cx + d, where a, b, c, and d are constants, has no solution only when the coefficients of x on each side of the equation are equal and the constant terms aren't equal. Dividing both sides of the given equation by 3 yields ke + 13 = 0.941 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer.

A certain product costs a company \$65 to make. The product is sold by a salesperson who earns a commission that is equal to 20% of the sales price of the product. The profit the company makes for each unit is equal to the sales price minus the combined cost of making the product and the commission. If the sales price of the product is \$100, which of the following equations gives the number of units, u, of the product the company sold to make a profit of \$6,840 ?

A. (100(1-0.2)-65)u = 6,840

B. (100-65)(1-0.8)u = 6,840

c. 0.8(100)-65u =6,840

- D. (0.2(100) +65)u = 6,840
#### ID: ae2287e2 Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is correct. The sales price of one unit of the product is qiven as \$100. Because the salesperson is awarded a commission equal to 20% of the sales price, the expression 100(1 – 0.2) gives the sales price of one unit after the commission is deducted. It is also given that the profit is equal to the sales price minus the combined cost of making the product, or \$65, and the commission: 100(1 - 0.2) - 65. Multiplying this expression by u gives the profit of u units: (100(1 – 0.2) – 65)u. Finally, it is given that the profit for u units is \$6,840; therefore (100(1 - 0.2) - 65)u = \$6,840.

Choice B is incorrect. In this equation, cost is subtracted before commission and the equation gives the commission, not what the company retains after commission. Choice C is incorrect because the number of units is multiplied only by the cost but not by the sale price. Choice D is incorrect because the value 0.2 shows the commission, not what the company retains after commission.

#### Townsend Realty Group Investments

The Townsend Realty Group invested in the five different properties listed in the table above. The table shows the amount, in dollars, the company paid for each property and the corresponding monthly rental price, in dollars, the company charges for the property at each of the five locations. Townsend Realty purchased the Glenview Street property and received a 40% discount off the original price along with an additional 20% off the discounted price for purchasing the property in cash. Which of the following best approximates the original price, in dollars, of the Glenview Street property?

- A. \$350,000
- B. \$291,700
- C. \$233,300
- D. \$175,000

### ID: 90095507 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale
{6}------------------------------------------------

Choice B is correct. Let x be the original price, in dollars, of the Glenview Street property. After the 40% discount, the price of the property became 0.6x dollars, and after the additional 20% off the discounted price, the price of the property became 0.8(0.6x). Thus, in terms of the original price of the property, x, the purchase price of the property is 0.48x . It follows that 0.48x = 140,000. Solving this equation for x gives x =291,666.6 Therefore, of the given choices, \$291,700 best approximates the original price of the Glenview Street property.

Choice A is incorrect because it is the result of dividing the purchase price of the property by 0.4, as though the purchase price were 40% of the original price. Choice C is incorrect because it is the closest to dividing the purchase price of the property by 0.6, as though the purchase price were 60% of the original price. Choice D is incorrect because it is the result of dividing the purchase price of the property by 0.8, as though the purchase price were 80% of the original price.

Each side of a 30-sided polygon has one of three lengths. The number of sides with length 8 centimeters (cm) is 5 times the number of sides n with length 3 cm. There are 6 sides with length 4 cm. Which equation must be true for the value of n?

A. 5n + 6 = 30

B. 6n + 6 = 30

C. 8n + 3n + 4n = 30

D. 8(5n) + 3n + 4(6) = 30

### ID: 0cb57740 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. It's given that each side of a 30-sided polygon has one of three lengths. It's also given that the number of sides with length 8 centimeters (cm) is 5 times the number of sides n with length 3 cm. Therefore, there are 5 × n, or 5m, sides with length 8 cm. It's also given that there are 6 sides with length 4 cm Therefore, the number of 3 cm, 4 cm, and 8 cm sides are n, 6, and 5m, respectively. Since there are a total of 30 sides, the equation n + 6 + 5n = 30 represents this situation. Combining like terms on the left-hand side of this equation yields 6n + 6 = 30. Therefore, the equation that must be true for the value of w is 6n + 6 = 30.

- D. 8 and 13

## ID: aee9fd2d Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. Multiplying both sides of the given equation by (3)(13), or 39, yields (39) ( ** ) = (39) ( ** ) , or 13(x +6) = 3(x + 6) Subtracting 3(x +6) from both sides of this equation yields 10(x +6) = 0. Dividing both sides of this equation by 10 yields x + 6 = 0. Therefore, if =2 = 0. then the value of x + 6 is 0. It follows that of the given choices, the value of x + 6 is between -2 and 2.

The equation 9x +5 = α(x + b), where a and b are constants, has no

solutions. Which of the following must be true?

l. a=9

II. b = 5

A. None

B. I only

C. I and II only

D. I and III only

#### ID: 3f8a701b Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. For a linear equation in a form ax +b = cx + d to have no solutions, the x-terms must have equal coefficients and the remaining terms must not be equal. Expanding the right-hand side of the given equation yields 9x + 5 = ax + ab. Inspecting the x-terms, 9 must equal a, so statement I must be true. Inspecting the remaining terms, 5 can't equal 9b. Dividing both of these quantities by 9 yields that b can't 5 9 . Therefore, statement III must be true. Since b can have any value other than 9 , statement II may or equal may not be true.

Choice A is incorrect. For the given equation to have no solution, both α = 9 and b ≠ 9 must be true. Choice B is incorrect because it must also be true that 9 . Choice C is incorrect because when a = 9, there are many values of b that lead to an equation having no solution. That is, b might be 5, but b isn't required to be 5.

A science teacher is preparing the 5 stations of a science laboratory. Each station will have either Experiment A materials or Experiment B materials, but not both. Experiment A requires 6 teaspoons of salt, and Experiment B requires 4 teaspoons of salt. If x is the number of stations that will be set up for Experiment A and the remaining stations will be set up for Experiment B, which of the following expressions represents the total number of teaspoons of salt required?

A. 5x

B. 10x

C. 2x +20

D. 10x +20

### ID: 628300a9 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is correct. It is qiven that x represents the number of stations that will be set up for Experiment A and that there will be 5 stations total, so it follows that 5 - x is the number of stations that will be set up for Experiment B. It is also given that Experiment A requires 6 teaspoons of salt and that Experiment B requires 4 teaspoons of salt, so the total number of teaspoons of salt required is 6x + 4(5 – x), which simplifies to 2x + 20.

A factory makes 9-inch, 7-inch, and 4-inch concrete screws. During a certain day, the number of 9-inch concrete screws that the factory makes is 5 times the number no of 7-inch concrete screws, and the number of 4-inch concrete screws is 22. During this day, the factory makes 100 concrete screws total. Which equation represents this situation?

A. 9(5n) + 7n + 4(22) = 100

B. 9n + 7n + 4n = 100

C. 5n + 22 = 100

D. 6n + 22 = 100

## ID: 38bf4e04 Answer

#### Correct Answer: D

### Rationale

Choice D is correct. It's given that during a certain day at a factory, the number of 7-inch concrete screws the factory makes is n and the number of 4-inch concrete screws the factory makes is 22. It's also given that during this day the number of 9inch concrete screws the factory makes is 5 times the number of 7-inch concrete screws, or 5%. Therefore, the total number of 7-inch, 9-inch, and 4-inch concrete screws is n + 22, or 6r + 22. It's given that during this day, the factory makes 100 concrete screws total. Thus, the equation 6n + 22 = 100 represents this situation.

Choice A is incorrect. This equation where the total length, in inches, of all the concrete screws, rather than the total number of concrete screws, is 100.

Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

Choice C is incorrect. This equation represents a situation where the total number of 9-inch concrete screws and 4-inch concrete screws, not including the 7-inch concrete screws, is 100.
