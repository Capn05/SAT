If x is the solution to the equation above, what is the value of x - 3 ?

ID: 7a5a74a6

3(2x-6)-11=4(x-3)+6

#### ID: 7a5a74a6 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. Because 2 is a factor of both 2x and 6, the expression 2x -6 can be rewritten as 2(x -3). Substituting 2(x – 3) for (2x – 6) on the left-hand side of the given equation yields 3(2)(x -3) - 11 = 4(x - 3) + 6, or 6(x - 3) - 11 = 4(x - 3) + 6. Subtracting 4(x - 3) from both sides of this equation yields 2(x - 3) - 11 = 6. Adding 11 to both sides of this equation yields 2(x - 3) = 17. Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields * −3 = 22 2 .

Alternate approach: Distributing 3 to the quantity (2x -6) on the left-hand side of the given equation and distributing 4 to the quantity (x -3) on the right-hand side yields 6x - 18 - 11 = 4x - 12 + 6, or 6x - 29 = 4x -6. Subtracting 4x from both sides of this equation yields 2x - 29 = - 6. Adding 29 to both sides of this equation yields 2x = 23. Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields * 23 17 - 3, or 2
- 3, or 2 - 3, or 2 - 2
- 3, or - 2 - 3, or - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 x - 3 is 2

2n+6=14

A tree had a height of 6 feet when it was planted. The equation above can be used to find how many years n it took the tree to reach a height of 14 feet. Which of the following is the best interpretation of the number 2 in this context?

A. The number of years it took the tree to double its height

B. The average number of feet that the tree grew per year

- C. The height, in feet, of the tree when the tree was 1 year old
- D. The average number of years it takes similar trees to grow 14 feet

#### ID: aa85b138 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. The height of the tree at a given time is equal to its height when it was planted plus the number of feet that the tree grew. In the given equation, 14 represents the height of the tree at the given time, and 6 represents the height of the tree when it was planted. It follows that 2n represents the number of feet

the tree grew from the time it was planted until the time it reached a height of 14 feet. Since n represents the number of years between the given time and the tree was planted, 2 must represent the average number of feet the tree grew each year.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from interpreting the coefficient 2 as doubling instead of as increasing by 2 each year. Choice C is incorrect. The height of the tree when it was 1 year old was 2(1) + 6 = 8 feet, not 2 feet.

Choice D is incorrect. No information is given to connect the growth of one particular tree to the growth of similar trees.

$$2x + 16 = a(x + 8)$$

In the given equation, a is a constant. If the equation has infinitely many solutions, what is the value of a?

#### ID: 15daa8d6 Answer

Correct Answer: 2

Rationale

The correct answer is 2. An equation with one variable, w, has infinitely many solutions only when both sides of the equation are equal for any defined value of x. It's given that 2x + 16 = a(x + 8), where a is a constant. This equation can be rewritten as 2(x + 8) = a(x + 8). If this equation has infinitely many solutions, then both sides of this equation are equal for any defined value of x. Both sides of this equation are equal for any defined value of x when 2 = a. Therefore, if the equation has infinitely many solutions, the value of a is 2.

Alternate approach: If the given equation, 2x + 16 = a(x + 8), has infinitely many solutions, then both sides of this equation are equal for any value of x. If x = 0, then substituting 0 for x in 2x + 16 = a(x + 8) yields 2(0) + 16 = a(0 + 8), or 16 = 8a. Dividing both sides of this equation by 8 yields 2 = a.

|       |  |  |  |  |

(b-2)x = 8

### ID: 12ee1edc Answer

Correct Answer: A

### Rationale

Choice A is correct. This equation has no solution when there is no value of x that produces a true statement. 8 Solving the given equation for x by dividing both sides by (b – 2) gives right-hand side of this equation will be undefined, and the equation will have no solution. Therefore, when b = 2, there is no value of x that satisfies the given equation.

Choices B, C, and D are incorrect. Substituting 4, 6, and 10 for b in the given equation yields exactly one solution, rather than no solution, for x. For example, substituting 4 for b in the given equation yields (4 - 2)x = 8, or 2x = 8. Dividing both sides of 2x = 8 by 2 yields x = 4. Similarly, if b = 6 or b = 10, x = 2 and x = 1, respectively.

In the equation above, a and b are constants. If the equation has infinitely many solutions, what are the values of a and b ?

A. a = 2 and b = 1 B. α=2 and b = 7 C. α = −2 and ь = 5 D. a = - 2 and b = - 5

### ID: 70e29454 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. Distributing the a on the left-hand side of the equation gives 3a – b – ax = −1 – 2x. Rearranging the terms in each side of the equation yields –ax + 3a – b = –2x –1. Since the equation has infinitely many solutions, it follows that the coefficients of x and the free terms on both sides must be equal. That is, -a = -2, or a = 2, and 3a - b = -1. Substituting 2 for a in the equation 3a – b = −1 gives 3(2) − b = −1, so b = 7.

Choice A is incorrect and may be the result of a conceptual error when finding the value of b. Choices C and D are incorrect and may result from making a sign error when simplifying.

An agricultural scientist studying the growth of corn plants recorded the height of a corn plant at the beginning of a study and the height of the plant each day for the next 12 days. The scientist found that the height of the plant increased by an average of 1.20 centimeters per day for the 12 days. If the height of the plant on the last day of the study was 36.8 centimeters, what was the height, in centimeters, of the corn plant at the beginning of the study?

### ID: f09097b1 Answer

### Rationale

The correct answer is 22.4. If the height of the plant increased by an average of 1.20 centimeters per day for 12 days, then its total growth over the 12 days was (1.20)(12) = 14.4 centimeters. The plant was 36.8 centimeters tall after 12 days, so at the beginning of the study its height was 36.8–14.4 = 22.4 centimeters. Note that 22.4 and 112/5 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer.

Alternate approach: The equation 36.8 = 12(1.20)+h can be used to represent this situation, where h is the height of the plant, in centimeters, at the beginning of the study. Solving this equation for h yields 22.4 centimeters.

What value of p is the solution of the equation above?

ID: 4f669597 2(p +1) +8(p -1) = 5p

#### ID: 4f669597 Answer

Rationale

The correct answer is 1.2. One way to solve the equation 2(p + 1) = 5p is to first distribute the terms outside the parentheses to the terms inside the parentheses: 2p +2 +8p =8 = 5p. Next, combine like terms on the left side of the equal sign: 10p =6 = 5p . Subtracting 10p from both sides yields =6 = = 5p . Finally, dividing both sides by =5 gives = = 6
dividing both sides by =5 gives = = 5 , which is equivalent to p = 1.2. Note that 1.2 and 6/5 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer.

Megan's regular wage at her job is p dollars per hour for the first 8 hours of work in a day plus 1.5 times her regular hourly wage for work in excess of 8 hours that day. On a given day, Megan worked for 10 hours, and her total earnings for that day were \$137.50. What is Megan's regular hourly wage?

A. \$11.75

B. \$12.50

C. \$13.25

D. \$13.75

#### ID: 36ab4122 Answer

Rationale

Choice B is correct. Since p represents Megan's regular pay per hour, 1.5p represents the pay per hour in excess of 8 hours. Since Megan worked for 10 hours, she must have been paid p dollars per hour for 8 of the hours plus 1.5p dollars per hour for the remaining 2 hours. Therefore, since Megan earned \$137.50 for the 10 hours, the situation can be represented by the equation 137.5 = 8p + 2(1.5)p. Distributing the 2 in the equation gives 137.5 = 8p + 3p, and combining like terms gives 137.5 = 11p. Dividing both sides by 11 gives p = 12.5. Therefore, Megan's reqular wage is \$12.50.

Choices A and C are incorrect and may be the result of calculation errors. Choice D is incorrect and may result from finding the average hourly wage that Megan earned for the 10 hours of work.

The width of a rectangular dance floor is w feet. The length of the floor is 6 feet longer than its width. Which of the following expresses the perimeter, in feet, of the dance floor in terms of w ?

A. 2w+6

B. 4w +12

c. w2+6

D. W2 +6w

### ID: 5ad9eff0 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. It is given that the width of the dance floor is w feet. The length is 6 feet longer than the width; therefore, the length of the dance floor is w +6. So the perimeter is W + W + (w +6) = 4w +12.

Choice A is incorrect because it is the sum of one length and one width, which is only half the perimeter. Choice C is incorrect and may result from using the formula for the area instead of the formula for the perimeter and making a calculation error. Choice D is incorrect because this is the area, not the perimeter, of the dance floor.
