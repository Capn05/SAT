The equation 5,48x + 7,30y = 1,277.94 represents this situation, where a is the number of smaller containers sold and y is the number of larger containers sold. According to the equation, which of the following represents the price, in dollars, of each smaller container?

A. 5.48

B. 7.30y

c. 7.30

D. 5.48x

#### ID: ee846db7 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. It's given that the store's sales of a certain Greek yogurt totaled 1,277.94 dollars last month. It's also given that the equation 5.48x + 7.30y = 1.277.94 represents this situation, where x is the number of smaller containers sold and y is the number of larger containers sold. Since & represents the number of smaller containers of yogurt sold, the expression 5.48x represents the total sales, in dollars, from smaller containers of yogurt. This means that x smaller containers of yourt were sold at a price of 5,48 dollars each. Therefore, according to the equation, 5.48 represents the price, in dollars, of each smaller container.

Choice B is incorrect. This expression represents the total sales, in dollars, from selling y larger containers of yogurt.

Choice C is incorrect. This value represents the price, in dollars, of each larger container of yogurt.

Choice D is incorrect. This expression represents the total sales, in dollars, from selling of smaller containers of yoqurt.

Line k is defined by y = 3x + 15. Line j is perpendicular to line k in the xy-plane. What is the slope of line ỷ?

## ID: 5b8a8475 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. It's given that line ; is perpendicular to line & in the xy-plane. It follows that the slope of line j is the opposite reciprocal of the k. The equation for line k is written in slope-intercept form y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept of the line. It follows that the slope of line k is 3. The opposite reciprocal of a number is —1 divided by the number. Thus, the opposite reciprocal of 3 is - 3 . Therefore, the slope of line j is - 1

3a+4b=25

A shipping company charged a customer \$25 to ship some small boxes and some large boxes. The equation above represents the relationship between a, the number of small boxes, and b, the number of large boxes, the customer had shipped. If the customer had 3 small boxes shipped, how many large boxes were shipped?

| A. 3 |  |
|------|--|
| B. 4 |  |
| C. 5 |  |
| D. 6 |  |

#### ID: b23bba4c Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. It's given that a represents the number of small boxes and b represents the number of large boxes the customer had shipped. If the customer had 3 small boxes shipped, then n = 3. Substituting 3 for a in the equation 3a +4b =25 yields 3(3) +4b =25 or 9 + 4b = 25. Subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation yields 4b = 16. Dividing both sides of this equation by 4 yields b = 4. Therefore, the customer had 4 large boxes shipped.

Choices A, C, and D are incorrect. If the number of large boxes shipped is 3, then b = 3. Substituting 3 for b in the given equation yields 3a+4(3) = 25 or 3a+12 = 25. Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation and 13 13 then dividing by 3 yields a = = 3 . However, it's given that the number of small boxes shipped, a, is 3, not 3 so b cannot equal 3. Similarly, if b = 5 or b = 6, then ( = = 3 or a = 3 , respectively, which is also not true.

x+y=75

The equation above relates the number of minutes, x, Maria spends running each day and the number of minutes, y, she spends biking each day. In the equation, what does the number 75 represent?

- A. The number of minutes spent running each day
- B. The number of minutes spent biking each day
- C. The total number of minutes spent running and biking each day
- D. The number of minutes spent biking for each minute spent running

#### ID: 87322577 Answer

Correct Answer: C

Rationale

Choice C is correct. Maria spends x minutes running each day and y minutes biking each day. Therefore, x + v represents the total number of minutes Maria spent running and biking each day. Because x + y = 75, it follows that 75 is the total number of minutes that Maria spent running and biking each day.

Choices A and B are incorrect. The number of minutes Maria spent running each day is represented by x and need not be 75. Similarly, the number of minutes that Maria spends biking each day is represented by y and need not be 75. The number of minutes Maria spends running each day and biking each day may vary; however, the total number of minutes she spends each day on these activities is constant and equal to 75. Choice D is incorrect. The number of minutes Maria spent biking for each minute spent running cannot be determined from the information provided.

- C. If 73 triangles were constructed, then 24 rectangles were constructed.
- D. If 73 triangles were constructed, then 24 paper straws were used.

#### ID: c6b151d4 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. It's given that 364 paper straws of equal length were used to construct triangles and rectangles, where no two polygons had a common side. It's also given that the equation 3x + 4y = 364 represents this situation, where x is the number of triangles constructed and y is the number of rectangles constructed. The equation (x, y) = (24, 73) means that if x = 24, then y = 73. Substituting 24 for x and 73 for y in 3x + 4y = 364 yields 3(24) + 4(73) = 364, or 364 = 364, which is true. Therefore, in this context, the equation (x, y) = (24, 73) means that if 24 triangles were constructed, then 73 rectangles were constructed.

B.y = - x - 4

$$\text{C. } \chi = -\chi - \frac{1}{4}$$

D.y = - 4x - 1

## ID: b2845d88 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. The slope of the line can be found by choosing any two points on the line, such as (4, –2) and (0, -1). Subtracting the y-values results in -2 - (-1) = -1, the change in y. Subtracting the x-values results in 4 – 0 = 4, the change in x. Dividing the change in y by the change in x yields 4 , the slope. The line intersects the y-axis at (0, –1), so –1 is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept. This information can be expressed in slope-intercept form as the equation -

Choice B is incorrect and may result from incorrectly calculating the slope and then misidentifying the slope as the y-intercept. Choice C is incorrect and may result from misidentifying the slope as the y-intercept. Choice D is incorrect and may result from incorrectly calculating the slope.

An employee at a restaurant prepares sandwiches and salads. It takes the employee 1,5 minutes to prepare a sandwich and 1.9 minutes to prepare a salad. The employee spends a total of 46.1 minutes preparing x sandwiches and y salads. Which equation represents this situation?

A. 1.9x + 1.5y = 46.1

B. 1.5x + 1.9y = 46.1

C. x + y = 46.1

D. 30.7x + 24.3y = 46.1

#### ID: b450ab03 Answer

Correct Answer: B

#### Rationale

Choice B is correct. It's given that the employee takes 1.5 minutes to prepare a sandwich. Multiplying 1.5 by the number of sandwiches, x, yields 1.5c, the amount of time the employee spends preparing & sandwiches. It's also given that the employee takes 1.9 minutes to prepare a salad. Multiplying 1.9 by the number of salads, y, yields 1.9g, the amount of time the employee spends preparing y salads. It follows that the total amount of time, in minutes, the employee spends preparing x sandwiches and y salads is 1.5m + 1.9g. It's given that the employee spends a total of 46.1 minutes preparing x sandwiches and y salads. Thus, the equation 1.5x + 1.9y = 46.1 represents this situation.

Choice A is incorrect. This equation represents a situation where it takes the employee 1.9 minutes, rather than 1.5 minutes, to prepare a sandwich and 1.5 minutes, rather than 1.9 minutes, to prepare a salad.

Choice C is incorrect. This equation represents a situation where it takes the employee 1 minute, rather than 1.5 minutes, to prepare a sandwich and 1 minute, rather than 1.9 minutes, to prepare a salad.

Choice D is incorrect. This equation represents a situation where it takes the employee 30.7 minutes, rather than 1.5 minutes, to prepare a sandwich and 24.3 minutes, rather than 1.9 minutes, to prepare a salad.

A city's total expense budget for one year was x million dollars. The city budgeted y million dollars for departmental expenses and 201 million dollars for all other expenses. Which of the following represents the relationship between x and y in this context?

A. x+y=201

B.x-y=201

C. 2x-y = 201

D.y-x=201

#### ID: 8adf1335 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. Of the city's total expense budget for one year, the city budgeted y million dollars for departmental expenses and 201 million dollars for all other expenses. This means that the expression y + 201

represents the total expense budget, in millions of dollars, for one year. It's given that the total expense budget for one year is x million dollars. It follows then that the expression y + 201 is equivalent to x, or y + 201 = x. Subtracting y from both sides of this equation yields 201 = x −y. By the symmetric property of equality, this is the same as x - y = 201

Choices A and C are incorrect. Because it's given that the total expense budget for one year, x million dollars, is comprised of the departmental expenses, y million dollars, and all other expenses, 201 million dollars, the expressions x + y and 2x - y both must be equivalent to a value greater than 201 million dollars. Therefore, the equations x + y = 201and 2x -y = 201aren't true. Choice D is incorrect. The value of x must be greater than the value of y. Therefore, y - x = 201 can't represent this relationship.

A. The total cost, in dollars, for all binders purchased

- B. The total cost, in dollars, for all notebooks purchased
- C. The total cost, in dollars, for all binders and notebooks purchased

D. The difference in the total cost, in dollars, between the number of binders and notebooks purchased

#### ID: dd797fe2 Answer

Correct Answer: C

#### Rationale

Choice C is correct. Since Mario purchased 4 binders that cost x dollars each, the expression 4x represents the total cost, in dollars, of the 4 binders he purchased 3 notebooks that cost y dollars each, the expression 3y represents the total cost, in dollars, of the 3 notebooks he purchased. Therefore, the expression 4x +3y represents the total cost, in dollars, for all binders and notebooks he purchased. In the given equation, the expression 4x + 3y is equal to 24. Therefore, it follows that 24 is the total cost, in dollars, for all binders and notebooks purchased.

Choice A is incorrect. This is represented by the expression 4x in the given equation. Choice B is incorrect. This is represented by the expression 3y in the given equation. Choice D is incorrect. This is represented by the expression | 4x - 3y

A gardener buys two kinds of fertilizer. Fertilizer A contains 60% filler materials by weight and Fertilizer B contains 40% filler materials by weight. Together, the fertilizers bought by the gardener contain a total of 240 pounds of filler materials. Which equation models this relationship, where x is the number of pounds of Fertilizer A and y is the number of pounds of Fertilizer B?

A. 0.4x +0.6y =240

B. 0.6x +0.4y =240

C. 40x +60y = 240

D. 60x + 40y = 240

#### ID: 789975b7 Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. Since Fertilizer A contains 60% filler materials by weight, it follows that x pounds of Fertilizer A consists of 0.6x pounds of filler materials. Similarly, y pounds of Fertilizer B consists of 0.4y pounds of filler materials. When x pounds of Fertilizer A and y pounds of Fertilizer B are combined, the result is 240 pounds of filler materials. Therefore, the total amount, in pounds, of filler materials in a mixture of x pounds of Fertilizer A and y pounds of Fertilizer B can be expressed as 0.6x +0.4y = 240.

Choice A is incorrect. This choice transposes the percentages of filler materials for Fertilizer B. Fertilizer A consists of 0.6x pounds of filler materials and Fertilizer B consists of 0.4y pounds of filler materials. Therefore, 0,6x +0,4y is equal to 240, not 0,4x +0,6y. Choice C is incorrect. This choice transposes the percentages of filler materials for Fertilizer B and incorrectly represents how to take the percentage of a value mathematically. Choice D is incorrect. This choice incorrectly represents how to take the percentage of a value mathematically. Fertilizer A consists of 0.6x pounds of filler materials, not 60x pounds of filler materials, and Fertilizer B consists of 0.4y pounds of filler materials, not 40y pounds of filler materials.

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. It's given that the equation 40x + 20y = 160 represents the number of sweaters, a, and the number of shirts, y, that Yesenia purchased for \$160. If Yesenia purchased 2 sweaters, the number of shirts she purchased can be calculated by substituting 2 for x in the given equation, which yields 40(2) + 20y = 160, or 80 + 20y = 160. Subtracting 80 from both sides of this equation yields 20y = 80. Dividing both sides of this equation by 20 yields y = 4. Therefore, if Yesenia purchased 2 sweaters, she purchased 4 shirts.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

If g represents the number of 10-ride passes Tony buys in a month and t represents the number of singleride passes Tony buys in a month, which of the following equations best represents the relationship between g and t ?

A.g+t=80

B. g + t = 1.50 + 12.50

C. 1.50g + 12.50t = 80

D. 12.50g +1.50t = 80

#### ID: dfa45424 Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. Since a 10-ride pass costs \$12.50 and g is the number of 10-ride passes Tony buys in a month, the expression 12.50q represents the amount Tony spends on 10-ride passes in a month. Since a

single-ride pass costs \$1.50 and t is the number of single-ride passes Tony buys in a month, the expression 1.50f represents the amount Tony spends on single-ride passes in a month. Therefore, the sum

12.50g + 1.50t represents the amount he spends on the two types of passes in a month. Since Tony spends a

total of \$80 on passes in a month, this expression can be set equal to 80, producing 12.50g + 1.50t = 80.

Choices A and B are incorrect. The expression q + f represents the total number of the two types of passes Tony buys in a month, not the amount Tony spends, which is equal to 80, nor the cost of one of each pass, which is equal to 1.50 + 12.50. Choice C is incorrect and may result from reversing the cost for each type of pass Tony buys in a month.

Characteristics for Rock Types

A city is planning to build a rock retaining wall, a monument, and a garden in a park. The table above shows four rock types that will be considered for use in the project. Also shown for each rock type is its weight per volume, in pounds per cubic foot (Ib/ft ), and the cost per pound, in dollars. The equation 0.03(120w)+0.18(180z)+3,385.80 = 7,576.20 gives the total

cost, in dollars, of the rocks used in the project in terms of the number of ff 3 of limestone, w, and the number of ft of basalt, z. All four rock types are used in the project. Which of the following is the best interpretation of 3,385.80 in this context?

- A. The cost of the granite and sandstone needed for the project
- B. The cost of the basalt and limestone needed for the project
- C. The cost of the basalt needed for the project
- D. The cost of the sandstone needed for the project

### ID: 520e6f5b Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is correct. The table shows the cost of limestone is \$0.03/lb, and the weight per volume for limestone is 120 lb/ft . Therefore, the term 0.03(120W) represents the cost, in dollars, of w ft of limestone. Similarly, the term 0.18(180z) represents the cost, in dollars, of z ft of basalt. The given equation shows that the total cost of all the rocks used in the project is \$7,576.20. Since it's given that all four rock types are used in the

{17}------------------------------------------------

project, the remaining term, 3,385.80, represents the cost, in dollars, of the granite and sandstone needed for the project.

Choice B is incorrect. The cost of basalt and limestone needed for the project can be represented by 0.18(180z)+0.03(120w). Choice C is incorrect. The cost of the basalt needed for the project can be

represented by the expression 0.18(1802). Choice D is incorrect and may result from neglecting to include granite in the rock types used for the project.

The table above shows some pairs of x values and y values. Which of the following equations could represent the relationship between x and y ?

A. y = 2x + 3

B. y = 3x-2

C. y = 4x - 1

D. y = 5x

### ID: b2de69bd Answer

Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is correct. Each of the choices is a linear equation in the form y = mx + b, where m and b are constants. In this equation, m represents the change in x by 1. From the table, it can be determined that the value of y increases by 2 for each increase in x by 1. In other words, for the pairs of x and y in the given table, m = 2. The value of b can be found by substituting the values of x and y from any row of the table and substituting the value of m into the equation y = mx + b and then solving for b. For example, using x = 1, y = 5, and m = 2 yields 5 = 2(1) + b. Solving for b yields b = 3. Therefore, the equation y = 2x + 3 could represent the relationship between x and y in the given table.

Alternatively, if an equation represents the relationship between x and y, then when each pair of x and y from the table is substituted into the equation, the result will be a true statement. Of the equations given, the equation y = 2x + 3 in choice A is the only equation that results in a true statement when each of the pairs of x and y are substituted into the equation.

Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because when at least one pair of x and y from the table is substituted into the equations given in these choices, the result is a false statement. For example, when the pair x = 4 and y = 11 is substituted into the equation in choice B, the result is 11 = 3(4) - 2, or 11 = 10, which is false.

ID: c5479c1a Answer

Correct Answer: D

Rationale

Choice D is correct. It's given that the shipment consists of 5-pound boxes with a total weight of 220 pounds. Let x represent the number of 5-pound boxes and y represent the number of 10-pound boxes in the shipment. Therefore, the equation 5x + 10y = 220 represents this situation. It's given that there are 13 10-pound boxes in the shipment. Substituting 13 for y in the equation 5x + 10y = 220 yields 5x + 10(13) = 220, or 5x + 130 = 220. Subtracting 130 from both sides of this equation yields 5x = 90. Dividing both sides of this equation by 5 yields 18. Thus, there are 18 5-pound boxes in the shipment.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

Choice C is incorrect. This is the number of 10-pound boxes in the shipment.

### ID: 1efd8202 Answer

Correct Answer: A

Rationale

Choice A is correct. Each of the given choices gives three values of x: 0, 2, and 4. Substituting 0 for a in the given equation yields y = 70(0) + 8, or y = 8. Therefore, when x = 0, the corresponding value of y for the given equation is 8. Substituting 2 for x in the given equation yields y = 70(2) + 8, or y = 148. Therefore, when x = 2, the corresponding value of y for the given equation is 148. Substituting 4 for x in the given

{22}------------------------------------------------

equation yields y = 70(4) + 8, or y = 288. Therefore, when x = 4, the corresponding value of y for the given equation is 288. Thus, if the three values of x are 0, 2, and 4, then their corresponding values of y are 8, 148, and 288, respectively, for the given equation.

Choice B is incorrect. This table gives three values of x and their corresponding values of y for the equation y = 4x + 70.

A. The price, in dollars, of one drink

- B. The price, in dollars, of one salad
- C. The number of drinks bought during the day
- D. The number of salads bought during the day

#### ID: b9839f9e Answer

Correct Answer: B

Rationale

Choice B is correct. It's given that 2.50x + 7.00y is equal to the total amount of money, in dollars, a food truck charges for x drinks and y salads. Since each salad has the same price, it follows that the total charge for y

salads is 7.00y dollars. When y = 1, the value of the expression 7.00 x 1, or 7.00 x 1, or 7.00. Therefore, the price for one salad is 7.00 dollars.

Choice A is incorrect. Since each drink has the same price, it follows that the total charge for x drinks is 2,50x

dollars. Therefore, the price, in dollars, for one drink is 2.50, not 7.00. Choices C and D are incorrect. In the given equation, F represents the total charge, in dollars, when x drinks and y salads are bought at the food truck. No information is provided about the number of drinks or the number of salads that are bought during the day. Therefore, 7.00 doesn't represent either of these quantities.

The equation 46 = 2a + 2b gives the relationship between the side lengths @ and b of a certain parallelogram. If α = 9, what is the value of b?

#### ID: 12ae3452 Answer

Correct Answer: 14

Rationale

The correct answer is 14. It's given that the equation 46 = 2a + 26 gives the relationship between the side lengths a and b of a certain parallelogram. Substituting 9 for a in the given equation yields 46 = 2(9) + 20, or 46 = 18 + 26. Subtracting 18 from both sides of this equation yields 28 = 26. Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields 14 = b. Therefore, if a = 9, the value of b is 14.

### ID: 535fa6e6 Answer

Correct Answer: D

### Rationale

Choice D is correct. Let prepresent the number of pounds of potatoes and let c represent the number of pounds of celery that Davio bought. It's qiven that potatoes cost \$0.69 per pound and celery costs \$0.99 per pound. If Davio spent \$5.34 in total, then the equation 0.69p + 0.99c = 5.34 represents this situation. It's also given that Davio bought twice as many pounds of celery as pounds of potatoes; therefore, c = 2p. Substituting 2p for c in the equation 0.69p + 0.99c = 5.34 yields 0.69p + 0.99(2p) = 5.34, which is equivalent to 0.69p + 1.98p = 5.34, or 2.67p = 5.34. Dividing both sides of this equation by 2.67 yields p = 2. Substituting 2 for p in the equation c = 2p yields c = 2(2), or c = 4. Therefore, Davio bought 4 pounds of celery.

Choice A is incorrect. This is the number of pounds of potatoes, not the number of pounds of celery, Davio bought.

- A. 5
- B. 12
- C. 14
- D. 50

## ID: 39571c77 Answer

#### Correct Answer: A

#### Rationale

Choice A is correct. Let x represent the number of rabbit snails that Naomi bought. It's given that each rabbit snail costs \$ 8. Therefore, the total cost, in dollars, of the rabbit snails that Naomi bought can be repression 8x. It's also given that each nerite snail costs \$ 6, and that Naomi bought 2 nerite snails. Therefore, the total cost, in dollars, of the nerite snails that Naomi bought is 62, or 12. Since Naomi bought both the nerite snails for a total of \$ 52, the equation 8x + 12 = 52 can be used to represent the situation. Subtracting 12 from both sides of this equation yields 8x = 40. Dividing both sides of this equation by 8 yields x = 5. Therefore, Naomi bought 5 rabbit snails.

Choice B is incorrect. This is the total cost, in dollars, of the nerite snails that Naomi bought, not the number of rabbit snails.

Choice C is incorrect. This is the cost, in dollars, of one rabbit snail, not the number of rabbit snails that Naomi bought.

Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

### ID: 6a12efbb Answer

Correct Answer: 15

#### Rationale

The correct answer is 15. It's given that the equation 46 = 2x + 2y gives the perimeter of a rectangular rug that has length x, in feet, and width y, in feet. It's also given that the width of the rug is 8 feet. Substituting 8 for y in the equation 46 = 2x + 2y yields 46 = 2x + 28, or 46 = 2x + 16. Subtracting 16 from both sides of this equation yields 30 = 2x. Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields 15 = x. Since x represents the length, in feet, of the rug, it follows that the length of the rug is 15 feet.

A food truck buys forks for \$0.04 each and plates for \$0.48 each. The total cost of £7 forks and y plates is \$661.76. Which equation represents this situation?

- A. 0.48x 0.04y = 661.76
- B. 0.04x 0.48y = 661.76
- C. 0.48x + 0.04y = 661.76
- D. 0.04x + 0.48y = 661.76

### ID: d1042cf8 Answer

#### Correct Answer: D

#### Rationale

Choice D is correct. It's given that the food truck buys forks for \$ 0.04 each. Therefore, the cost, in dollars, of x forks can be represented by the expression 0.04x. It's also given that the food truck buys plates for \$ 0.48 each. Therefore, the cost, in dollars, of y plates can be represented by the expression 0.48y. Since the total cost of x forks and y plates is \$ 661.76, the equation 0.04x + 0.48y = 661.76 represents this situation.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

Choice C is incorrect. This equation represents a situation in which the food truck buys forks for \$ 0.48 each and plates for \$ 0.04 each.
