      "question_text": "The conservator paused before the damaged fresco, resisting the familiar impulse to \"restore\" what history had edited. A brightened sky here, a reconstructed face there—each gesture risked trading patina for pastiche. The goal, she argued, was not to make the wall look new but to let it speak honestly: to stabilize what time had stressed, reveal what remains, and leave legible the intervals of loss. Every additional brushstroke, however well-intentioned, would say as much about the restorer as the original painter and might eclipse the very record that made the work worth saving.

      "question_text": "Proponents of carbon markets often point to offsets as a pragmatic bridge: fund a forest here to counterbalance a smokestack there. Yet the arithmetic can conceal as much as it clarifies. If a firm claims net-zero by financing distant sequestration while its own facilities emit unabated, a ledger may appear balanced without any local reduction in pollution or progress toward decarbonizing its operations. Offsets have their place, but without stringent limits and transparent accounting, they risk becoming a virtue on paper that defers hard changes in practice. What is the author's primary concern about the use of offsets as described in the passage?",

      "question_text": "The instructor described skepticism not as a sneer at truth but as a discipline for approaching it. Doubt, in this view, is not paralysis; it is a method for distinguishing what one merely prefers from what one can actually defend. To withhold judgment, temporarily and purposefully, is to give an argument the chance to earn assent rather than inherit it. The habit of testing claims, the instructor said, makes belief more—not less—capable of guiding action. Which choice best states the main idea of the passage?",

      "question_text": "Our dashboard glows with impressive counts—downloads, sign-ups, minutes in-app—yet the bucket is leaking faster than we can pour. Last month’s cohort tried the product and drifted away; this month’s cohort looks poised to repeat the pattern. We can buy attention, but rented attention leaves when the ad spend stops. The next quarter will fix activation friction and the long, quiet stretch after first use where people forget why they came. A product that earns return visits does not need to shout to be heard. The passage most strongly suggests that the founder would treat which metric as the clearest indicator of product health?",

      "question_text": "A diary, we assume, is a refuge for candor—but it is also an architecture of omission. The facts most troubling to the writer may be fenced out by euphemism or silence, and the very dailiness of entries can lull readers into mistaking regularity for completeness. The result is not falsehood so much as curvature: the record bends toward what the diarist can bear to recollect. If we learn from diaries, it is as much from the gaps as from the glittering particulars they preserve. According to the passage, what can be inferred about omissions in diaries?",

      "question_text": "Archaeologists charted pottery fragments along the old ridgelines and found a tidy corridor of shards. It would be tempting to declare a trade route on that evidence alone—until one notices that lowland soils, more acidic and farmed for centuries, rarely preserve ceramics at all. The map of surviving fragments is not a map of everything that once was; it is a palimpsest shaped by burial, breakage, chemistry, and chance, as well as by ancient merchants.

Critics called the reversal a failure. But revision is not betrayal—it is the work of science made visible. The more directly officials communicate what is known, what is probable, and what remains uncertain, the more the public can adjust behavior without feeling misled.

This does not prove that no one is speaking; it sharpens the questions we can ask. Perhaps transmitters are rare, faint, brief, misaligned with our schedules, or conversing in bands we have not yet thought to monitor.

But listen to where it reappears: slowed and darkened in the strings after a bright statement in the winds, inverted in a moment of doubt, hammered into insistence just before the last cadence. Repetition, here, is not redundancy but argument—the motif tries on positions until it belongs to the whole.

Yet models trained on sparse, uneven data can converge on a polished, standardized voice that trims dialectal edges and domestic metaphors. Without community governance—deciding what to encode, how to annotate, and when to prefer ambiguity—software may become an arbiter of correctness rather than a tool of continuity. The technology can help, but not as a substitute for living stewards. Which choice best captures the central claim of the passage?",
