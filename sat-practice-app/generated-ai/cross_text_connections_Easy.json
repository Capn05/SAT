Supporters argue that libraries remain vital community hubs, especially for people who lack reliable internet at home.\n\nText 2\n\nOnline databases and open-access materials have made information easier to find, but not everyone knows how to evaluate sources or navigate paywalls. Librarians can guide patrons to credible resources and teach research skills that improve information literacy.\n\nBased on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?",

The authors conclude that building more protected lanes is the best way to make streets safer.\n\nText 2\n\nSome residents worry that new bike lanes remove parking and change traffic patterns. Still, they acknowledge that protected lanes can improve safety. They argue that any expansion should consider local needs, loading zones, and complementary traffic-calming measures.\n\nBased on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the claim in Text 1 that building more protected bike lanes is the best way to make streets safer?",

Preventing new plastic from reaching the water is critical; otherwise, cleanup efforts will always be chasing an ongoing problem.\n\nBased on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?",
