      "question_text": "Conventional histories of cartography trace a near-linear progression from symbolic medieval mappae mundi to empirically grounded modern maps. Printing, the story goes, standardized technique and spread accurate geographic knowledge. But shipping records and surviving coastal charts from the 17th century suggest a more uneven evolution: ports and trade routes were mapped with striking precision while inland regions remained resolutely schematic. Consequently, claims of uniform improvement obscure how accuracy emerged piecemeal, driven by commercial priorities. Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?",

Developers fund restoration or protection projects scored against standardized metrics, and model projections convert future benefits into present credits. Yet field ecologists note that baseline data are sparse, reference sites are contested, and recovery trajectories highly variable.

      "question_text": "Press releases tout silicon anodes as the imminent solution to range anxiety, promising to more than double electric vehicle capacity. Laboratory cells do achieve high specific capacity, but repeated lithiation fractures pure silicon, swelling volume and degrading cycle life. Composite designs that embed silicon in resilient matrices mitigate these effects, though at substantial cost and with modest performance trade-offs. The near term, then, looks less like a leap and more like incremental gains via careful engineering. Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?",

But lesion studies, developmental data, and fMRI meta-analyses indicate that empathic processes draw on distributed networks for affect, attention, and perspective taking, with mirror-related activity varying by task.

      "question_text": "It seems intuitive that more streams always mean more income for artists. Under the dominant pro-rata model, however, a subscriber’s fee is pooled across the platform and distributed by overall market share, so a niche artist’s streams are diluted by top-chart plays. Trials of a 'user-centric' model—allocating each listener’s fee only to what that listener actually played—suggest modest shifts, benefiting smaller catalogs in some genres. The choice of accounting method, more than aggregate stream counts, thus largely determines revenue distribution. Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?",

Yet meta-analyses report small benefits for foundational skills when practice is brief and well designed, while excessive assignments correlate with disengagement.
