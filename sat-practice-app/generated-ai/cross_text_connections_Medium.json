      "question_text": "Text 1\n\nUrban planners in Brookfield argue that installing rooftop gardens across commercial buildings can significantly reduce localized temperatures and alleviate stormwater runoff. A pilot block with five vegetated roofs recorded cooler rooftop surface temperatures and reduced runoff during summer storms. Proponents claim these results suggest that widespread adoption would notably reduce urban heat.\n\nText 2\n\nAn environmental engineering review notes that rooftop gardens' benefits vary widely with plant selection, maintenance, building insulation, and the proportion of roofs converted. Modeling studies indicate citywide temperature effects remain modest unless coverage reaches a substantial share of rooftops, though co-benefits like habitat creation and runoff reduction are still meaningful.\n\nBased on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the claim in Text 1 that rooftop gardens can \"notably reduce urban heat\"?",

They cite lifecycle assessments showing lower total emissions compared with internal-combustion cars after the first several years of use. According to one policy brief, EVs are <u>unequivocally cleaner across their entire lifecycle</u> than gasoline vehicles.\n\nText 2\n\nA sustainability researcher agrees that EVs can reduce emissions but emphasizes that benefits depend on the electricity mix, battery manufacturing practices, and end-of-life management.
