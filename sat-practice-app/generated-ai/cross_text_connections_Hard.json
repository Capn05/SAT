They cite climate models indicating relatively predictable radiative forcing and propose SAI as a necessary interim measure while decarbonization accelerates.\n\nText 2\n\nAn ethicist contends that even if models predict a cooling effect, SAI raises unresolved governance and justice problems: risk distribution will be uneven, exit strategies are unclear, and transboundary consent is practically unattainable. The ethicist argues that prioritizing rapid deployability without legitimate global oversight magnifies moral hazard.\n\nBased on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely characterize the conclusion in Text 1 that SAI is a \"necessary interim measure\"?",
