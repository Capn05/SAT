This repository currently contains a directory `sat-practice-app`. More information will be added as the project develops.

## Installation

This project is primarily written in JavaScript.  To get started, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

**Prerequisites:**

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher recommended)
*   npm (usually installed with Node.js)

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Capn05/SAT.git
    cd sat-study
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the `sat-practice-app` directory:**

    ```bash
    cd sat-practice-app
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    Since a `package.json` file was not found, specific installation instructions cannot be provided.  If a `package.json` file is added to the `sat-practice-app` directory in the future, you would typically run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    *Note: This step is currently hypothetical and will only work if a `package.json` file is added to the project.*
